Title: South Korea: This is what happens Next
Content: South Korea This is what happens Next South Korea politics united unanimously behind their new leader Kim Jong Eun after several months of in-fighting. Kim Jong Eun slays several generals in brutal night raids to make his point including famous leader Ji Ko Pyŏn and Jin Hwang and several of their staff. In February of 2012 he has gained full control and starts flaunting his new found power. He performs several misses tests, one of which ends up in uninhabited part of China raising more than just eyebrows in China . He is known for a high use of drugs and is known to keep several hundred women in his chambers. The Chinese ambassador knowing that the young new leader is reckless and fears nothing reports this back to China. China decides that South Korea has reached a 'tipping point' and by summer of 2012 will hit another economic collapse that will spill thousands of North Koreans over its border. Seeing an opportunity, the Chinese government order an immediate invasion of North Korea in March of 2012, not following strict advice from NATO, the US and the UN to not go into the country. North Korea surrenders almost immediately to China and give them full sovereign power, Kim Jong Eun is executed and China adds the North Korean Army to their PLO overnight. China propgranda is places all over North Korea and the border between South Korea the North is increased by 10 fold. Meanwhile South Korea is appalled, wanting reunification not a new north Communist state with even more power than before. Japan is also scared and the United States removes any provisions or encouragement to any Article 9 laws that were still followed in ideology or law allowing the Japanese to start huge increases to their "Japanese Defense Force" and turn it into a regular army. The United States with encouragement from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, Philippines and Australia moves three Aircraft carriers and several Marine Expeditionary Forces 11th,13th and 15th to Taiwan in retaliation for invading North Korea without 'the worlds permission' and as a self-defense measure. Northrop Grumman and SAIC get immediate contracts to retro fit the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet and give it to Japan. The other reserve fleets get immediate orders to get cleaned up and evaluations on their readiness. China instantly declares war on Taiwan and 'anyone that follows them'. This prompts the United States to declare a state of emergency, then finally War with China by May of 2012. if this is fun I will add more, just let me know

Title: If the U.S. pulled out of South Korea and the Philippines it would be a major win for China politically, militarily and economically in the East.
Content: If the U.S. pulled out of South Korea and the Philippines it would be a major win for China politically, militarily and economically in the East. I'm an American who has been living in South Korea for the past six years and have seen the love hate relationship between Koreans and the U.S. up close. They admire our concepts of democracy and individuality, enjoy our pop culture and always want to learn more English. But many especially the young resent our military bases stationed there as well as our economic trade policies which only appears to be giving more profits to the major corporations here while wiping out the smaller local businesses. The older generation, however, still remember the Korean war and the Japanese Occupation and will always support a U.S. presence, because they know that as history has proven over and over again that China and Japan will try to dominate the area if left unchecked. I myself have many conflicting feelings and opinions about where the U.S. needs to go in terms of foreign policy and how Korea also needs to proceed in dealing with North Korea and especially China in the near future to prosper and truly become a democratic nation. Still, I can honestly tell you guys that for the past two decades South Korea has been obsessed with America -- half the signs in this country are in English and most Korean kids strive to learn English. However, the past few years there has been a strong push back on U.S. culture like getting rid of English on entrance exams while Chinese influence is rising rapidly. Many parents are having their children learn Chinese, I am friends with many South Korean business leaders who have set up companies in China in the past few years, and now I hear Chinese spoken as often as much as English when I walk around the streets in Seoul. I know that many Americans want the U.S. to leave other countries, especially Ron Paul supporters, but there is a lot of historical, political, financial, and strategical reasons why the U.S. maintaing a presence in key foreign countries is somewhat necessary unless you want to cede massive power to China. These are complicated times and I think people need to think long and hard about what is happening in the world before getting sucked into theories, slogans, and sound bites. Yes there are a lot of negatives in the U.S. policing the world, but sometimes in some places it might be necessary. Without support a lot of the areas in the world can easily regress back into fascist states and that would mean more injustices and suffering and quite possibly a major war. U.S. foreign policy for each region of the world has its own negatives and positives and complications specific to that area's history, economics, religion, and strategic location. I agree that U.S. foreign policy is sometimes just wrong but sometimes it needs thoughtful ideas for many beneficial reasons on both sides. So please do not accept blanket theories and ideas that do not cover the specifics of each situation. Sometimes the answer is simply not this or that but a series of compromises.

Goose-stepping soldiers, mobile rocket launchers and tanks rumbled through the streets below in a celebration broadcast on state television. North Korea s humiliation after a long-range rocket that disintegrated within minutes of liftoff on Friday increases the chance of Kim ordering an atomic test to regain face, South Korean Deputy Defence Minister Lim Kwan Bin said. The launch also ended a U.S. food-aid deal. Kim is very aware of how powerful the military is and knows his only strategy is to keep selling the military-first policy, said Koh Yu Hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Seoul s Dongguk University. Stability is what the young Kim needs most and he needs the full support of the military.

Title: Is Kim Jung-eun's position in the DPRK just a figure head being led by his advisers, or is he actually making military decisions? Could someone explain the actual power that he wields?
Content: Is Kim Jung-eun's position in the DPRK just a figure head being led by his advisers, or is he actually making military decisions? Could someone explain the actual power that he wields? I've never really understood it, I always took him to be the "face of the country" even though he's technically the dictator, I can't see him making any REAL decisions without a lot of advisement.

Title: What would happen if Taiwan joined the US and South Korean armies in fighting North Korea?
Content: What would happen if Taiwan joined the US and South Korean armies in fighting North Korea? I have heard talk that this might happen in July or August, purely by hearsay from a friend who was sent an article about it from a Taiwanese newspaper of what I don't have the link but am getting it soon I understand this is a hypothetical question but I think it is something that might be debatable but what exactly would happen. Taiwan is still legally apart of China but operates as a semi-rogue sovereign nation. Today China showed it support of North Korea and praised them in their efforts, but their nation is still not in full support of North Korea. If Taiwan decided to join forces with the South and US if the war were to start again, would China invade Taiwan or what side would China take on the efforts of a spark to the Korean war. Alternatively would China direct the Taiwanese military to join with them in fighting against the South and US of which Taiwan would probably say no to doing ? Just looking for a little more insight of what I know about the cross-strait relations and the growing tensions out here in the East.

Group of Springhill South Korea The Laziest Scams in Internet History Zimbio GROUP OF SPRINGHILL SOUTH KOREAGroup of Springhill South Korea 2. Business Week Zimbio April 20th 2012 - A certain Sehwan Jung in South Korea has been sending a number of desperate requests for funds over Twitter I am in urgent need of money.Can you lend me 500,000 dollars?I will make it up to youlater. A diabolical plot, indeed, though Mr. Jung s scam is unlikely to work. For one, people can see everything someone sends on Twitter and quickly realize he s sent the exact same message over and over. For another, he is tweeting almost exclusively to celebrities, including Channing Tatum, Rosario Dawson, Carly Simon, journalist Nicholas Kristof who today sarcastically answered, Sure! , and the foreign minister of Bahrain, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa. 3. Now this one is a real winner, says Dan Ring, a spokespersonfor Boston-based data protection company Sophos. SehwanJung s list of celebrities is almost as entertaining and asrandom as his actual request, and it s one of the moreoptimistic requests out there. I hope there s no way someonewill fall for this. - Group of Springhill South KoreaThe Sehwan gambit joins the following examples as one ofthe laziest scams in Internet history.

Title: China And The Dual Use Scam:South Korea Group of Springhill (Tvinx :: News)
Content: China And The Dual Use Scam South Korea Group of Springhill Tvinx News April 26, 2012 The United States is openly accusing China of supplying North Korea s missile program with components and technology. This may have something to do with intense effort to recover components of the failed North Korean rocket launch on April 13th. The debris of the rocket fell into shallow water off the west coast of South Korea. Russian, Chinese, and American ships, and perhaps submarines, also joined the search. South Korea called off its search on the 17th but the U.S. appeared to be continuing. The water where the debris fell is no deeper than 100 meters 310 feet , making it easy to search for and recover parts of the rocket. If some of those recovered components can be identified as Chinese there could be problems. China has agreed to abide by embargos on North Korea, but Chinese firms are notorious for ignoring their government and just selling to whoever will buy. Ignoring this behavior is not official Chinese policy but accepting bribes to look the other way is a long accepted Chinese practice. If the U.S. or South Korea recover Chinese rocket components from the ocean floor China will simply deny any knowledge of Chinese firms selling rocket components to North Korea, or claim that the rocket components were dual use which could be technically true . China may even agree to prosecute errant firms but these prosecutions are mainly for show. That approach has worked for years and it will take some hard-ball, behind-the-scenes diplomacy to force the Chinese government to act. That sometimes works but usually not for long. The U.S. also accused China of selling North Korea a large transport vehicle that the North Koreans modified to carry their latest long-range missile in an April 15th parade. The Chinese truck manufacturer eventually admitted this and said it was not illegal because the truck was designed to haul non-military cargo but, as is the case with many dual-use technologies, could easily be adapted to military use. The Chinese manufacturer added that the truck in question was an excellent vehicle and there were many satisfied users.

Title: North Korea resumes work on nuclear reactor: Report
Content: North Korea resumes work on nuclear reactor Report Seoul North Korea has resumed construction work on an experimental light water reactor ELWR in a move that could extend its capacity to produce more material for nuclear weapons, website 38North reported on Thursday. Based on April 30 satellite images, work halted in December at the reactor had now re-started, said the website, run by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University and former US State Department official Joel Wit. The construction activity comes as Pyongyang has stepped up progress towards conducting a third nuclear test, perhaps using highly enriched uranium for the first time, despite warnings from the United States and China. "Pyongyang's construction of an ELWR - which the North Koreans have indicated is the prototype for additional reactors - as well as a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon, is an important indication of the North's intention to move forward with the expansion of its nuclear weapons stockpile in the future," 38North said. It said the reactor could be operational in 1-2 years and that North Korea had almost completed the reactor containment building, based on the satellite images. North Korea says it needs nuclear power to provide electricity, but has also boasted of its nuclear deterrence capacity and has traded nuclear technology with Syria, Libya and likely Myanmar and Pakistan.

Content: How many people do you know are actually aware of what's going on in North Korea? Why isn't it common knowledge that 200,000 men, women, and children are currently being tortured, executed, and raised like cattle in isolated concentration camps? I feel like this is a campaign that reddit could get behind to help raise awareness...it's not much, but like they say, knowledge is power. These crime against humanity deserve attention.

Title: Visiting South Korea for two weeks. Will I need to get a visa prior to arriving in Korea?
Content: Visiting South Korea for two weeks. Will I need to get a visa prior to arriving in Korea? I'm a US citizen and will be flying to Korea in September. I was recently stationed at Osan AB, ROK US Air Force and will be returning for personal reasons. I have a valid passport and will only be staying for 2 weeks. I found this on Korea's consular page and it would seem like I don't need a visa, but Japan had the same thing and they gave me issues. Can anyone give me advice? "On November 17, 2008, the Republic of Korea joined the U.S. Visa Waiver Program VWP . As a result, on reciprocity, U.S. citizens can visit the Republic of Korea without a visa for duration of up to 90 days of less if the purpose of the trip is for fourism, business, attendance at a conference or visiting families or relatives. Extension of stay is not permitted "

Content: What is it about South Korea that makes it so special to Americans? Did it start with the Korean war? I have a feeling that to many Americans living a few years in Korea is not much different from living a few years in Canada, except of course the obvious things like language and culture. Is this because Korea is so technologically advanced or has close ties with the US due to North Korea or that you can easily find jobs as tutors or work at a Korean-based US firm?

Will I need to file a tax return with the U.S.A. and is my income in Korea taxable by Uncle Sam?

Content: Hey, a couple seeking a job to teach English in South Korea...can you help? Hey everyone, So my fiancé and I are hoping to go to south Korea in mid September or early October to teach English. We are super excited about this opportunity, and we would love to have your help if you have already established yourself there. I have a degree in Art Education k-12 so I have a teaching background, and my fiancé has a BA in English. We both are super easy going, very friendly, and we have good work ethics. So far we have been applying to a couple of schools, and yes we visit davescafe.com everyday. We will post our resumes there today. The one complaint about the website so far is that it's mostly recruiting agencies posting the jobs...we would prefer not to go through an agency if we can help it. We feel that we might get better jobs by getting it through a friend or the actual school. Here's my request if you know of a school hiring please let us know. I love the people of Reddit and i hope maybe someone can help us out. We would appreciate anything you can recommend to us. We both have passports, notorized copies of our diplomas and our college transcripts, and we are currently waiting for our FBI background check to come back. We can leave any time after August but preferably mid september. PM me if you have any more questions. If you can help, great! If not, hey, I still like ya Thanks for reading. P.s I typed this on an iPad, sorry for the spelling or gramma mistakes!

Title: How would it be for me to visit north korea?
Content: How would it be for me to visit north korea? I'd really like to visit north korea just too see things first hand. But the potential problem is that I'm an American half korean. I've heard stories about how north korea is eager to catch south koreans and "re-educate" them into their system. Is that something I should be worried about? Or would they know that I'm not really a candidate for re-education?

Title: Atheists of r/northkorea, can we talk about Christianity as a reaction to Pyongyang's oppression?
Content: Atheists of r northkorea, can we talk about Christianity as a reaction to Pyongyang's oppression? I just read The Aquariums of Pyongyang, and I'm an atheist. So the author's enthusiasm for God and Christianity should seem abhorrent to me. Boo religion, and all that. But it doesn't. The man survived ten years in Yodok. He survived unspeakable tortures I have no way to imagine. He specifically says that the idea of a loving God stands in stark contrast to the cold nature of life in the world of Kim Il-sung's creation. I feel like if religion gets him through the night, who am I to argue? I know there are many atheists on reddit. Those here also have some interest in North Korea. So I'm wondering, for those of you inclined to avoid religion and so forth, what do you think of a North Korean embracing Christianity?

Title: Why does South Korea especially seem to have such strong drug laws? Is it cultural or just a phase of government?
Content: Why does South Korea especially seem to have such strong drug laws? Is it cultural or just a phase of government? I just read some stuff about the mandatory medical exams for visitors to S. Korea, and it struck me as pretty authoritarian for their government to take it upon themselves to test anyone entering the country. After some further reading it really just surprises me exactly how no-tolerance they are I know the US is too, legislatively speaking, but their enforcement is seemingly far more intense . Is this just endemic of a cultural-level rejection of drugs or is it more of the current flavor of Korean politics? Sorry if this is the wrong place to pose such a question I figured here would be better than AskReddit.

Worth noting that the money has marks on it and small stains so I think its been in use. While all the other tourists mostly americans were buying up all the american military paraphenalia, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get a little piece of the DPRK for myself I haven't tasted the wine yet. Perhaps someone here has and can tell us if it tastes any good?

Title: Any advice on traveling to North Korea during a student exchange in Seoul?
Content: Any advice on traveling to North Korea during a student exchange in Seoul? I'll be spending the Spring semester of 2013 in Yonsei, and the proximity of North Korea is quite tempting as traveling there would definitely be a unique experience. Is a trip like this even possible during a 4-5 month stay in South Korea? Will there be consequences on either border due to me having either country's visa in my passport? How much would it cost for me to travel to Pyongyang from Seoul? I am aware that if this indeed is possible I will have to travel via China to Pyongyang. The reason for me asking is that I simply don't know where to start looking for info, as travel agencies here in Finland aren't apparently very busy with travelers seeking to spend holidays in North Korea.

Title: Questions about living in South Korea.
Content: Questions about living in South Korea. Ill start by introducing myself. Im a 21 year old guy from Sweden, planning on moving to South Korea. The reason for moving to South Korea is that my company is running itself. Not beeing any interested in living the rest of my life in Sweden, im now taking a pretty big step and ive some plans on moving to South Korea. And ive spent 2 weeks in Seoul on vacation and I just fell in love. I didnt experience the "ordinary life" of an inhabitant of Seoul, just a tourist p.o.v. So I have some questions that i would love to get answered by someone living there! The questions i bring to the table - The living standard there. not asking if people are poor, just how a regular schedule looks like. - How well the people of SKorea are at speaking and understanding english. - What city i should consider moving to. - How are the traffic, is buying a motorcycle something cool, or not that wise? - The price of foodstuff, drinks, etc. - Im allergic, do they have any special "shop" or section for that in the food-places fuck forgot the name or do i need to be on my toes when im buying something. --- I do have alot of questions, i will prolly fill this post with more as time flies by. Sincerly Anton "the guy" from Sweden.

Title: Are non-legal marriages common in South Korea?
Content: Are non-legal marriages common in South Korea? I'm American and my girlfriend is Korean not Korean American . We met while she was working in Los Angeles for a few years, but has since moved back to Korea where we've been maintaining our relationship long-distance. Our relationship has been getting more and more serious to the point where we've been considering marriage. She told me that when we do get married, that she doesn't want it to be legal. She still wants to have the ceremony and reception and everything, but she doesn't want a marriage contract immediately. She only wants to sign it after a few years of being married. I was taken aback by this because it seems like she just wants an easy out just in case. I've been taught that marriage is a lifetime commitment. She said that this is very common in Korea but when I search the web for instances like this, I can't find any. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks ahead of time.

We have remained, a small but steady source of news and a source for learning more about NK. I encourage you to check out the reading list and the films documentaries list It's really shocking how much of the general population in the developed and developing worlds are unaware of North Korea. I see education a prime way of encouraging change over the long-term. It's too bad we don't really learn about North Korea in high school.

My wonderful girlfriend is coming to see me in 4 weeks and I am trying to make this trip as memorable as possible. Right now I am planning to take her to Busan for a few nights after she gets here and if I'm able to find transportation, head up to Andong for a night. After that I would like to spend 3 days in Seoul to show her everything possible. How is this looking so far? Are there any must-see places I could fit in there? I was able to book tickets through Korail to get to Busan but I'm failing to find any online resource to purchase bus train subway tickets from Busan to Andong. Any suggestions?

Title: Signs to look for if North Korea is trying to rejoin humanity
Content: Signs to look for if North Korea is trying to rejoin humanity North Korea has used intense information control to control its population for generations. There now exist drastic differences between the facts an average North Korean believes to be true and what is factual. Before North Korea can become an open society the realities of the world technological advancements, the wealth other countries have must be admitted to, with whatever spin. I believe a very useful herald of an attempt by NK leaders to rejoin the rest of the world will be internal propaganda changing to reflect the reality of how people in other cultures live. I think the present attempt to present Kim Jong Un as a technocrat is a really good sign. Your thoughts?

Title: Plan on moving to South Korea for a one year teaching gig in the summer, have a few questions that I couldn't find answers to in the sub's history.
Content: Plan on moving to South Korea for a one year teaching gig in the summer, have a few questions that I couldn't find answers to in the sub's history. Hi folks, I anticipate moving to South Korea from the U.S. this upcoming summer to teach English on a one-year contract. Right now I'm considering trying to work in Seoul, but is there a different place within the country you'd recommend? I've figured out some things, like to bank with KEB, bring extra deodorant and toothpaste but several things still elude me. I do a significant amount of console gaming through work as a gaming critic, and will need to bring my PS3 and 360 with me, along with my laptop. Are there any customs restrictions or fees for bringing these items, and probably six or seven games between the two? As for luggage, bringing a carry on with the laptop, a few books and climbing shoes harness, and then checking a dufflebag with my gaming electronics, clothes and toiletries. Is this advisable? How efficient are the Korean airports with checked luggage? Want to make sure the consoles arrive and are intact. After discovering my U.S. cellphone carrier wants to charge 2 per minute of use, I figured getting a new phone in Korea is a wise move. What cell carriers should I look into for a Samsung, Motorola or LG smartphone? About how much do call data plans cost per month? Figure I'll use Seoul's massive wifi grid to call people back home on Skype. Will I need to acquire electrical outlet adapters for any electronics? Will the different media formats I assume Korea isn't NTSC be an issue using electronics? Playing games from Korea over Xbox Live, PSN, etc. Are there any free online programs you recommend for learning basic Korean? What didn't I ask that I should plan for? Thanks for all the help!

Content: Why is Kim Jong-un's true age a kept secret? Nobody knows how old KJU really is or when his birthday is, not even BBC News, who can only say "Born in 1983 or early 1984". I understand North Korea is an extremely closed society but I can't fathom why such an innocuous detail about the head of state would be kept a secret, especially considering that the Kims are practically worshipped. If anything I would expect the opposite, like for his birthday to be a patriotic holiday or something. Does anyone know why this is?

Content: Question At what point does the United States have a moral obligation to protect itself from North Korea, given their direct and increasingly credible threats of a nuclear attack? I'd like to get a debate going on this issue amongst other IR people here. Given that North Korea has tested three bombs and is considering testing a fourth, are increasing their range of missiles substantially, and have expressly said that they intend to hit the US with a nuclear weapon, when, in your opinion, would be the appropriate time for the US to take preemptive military action? Surely the US can't stand by and allow it to be attacked with a nuclear weapon. What taepodong would let that happen? sorry

Content: Politics DPRK I'm familiar with the history, yet still I must ask Is the DPRK not aware that the refugees are more powerful than any nuclear weapon? I've been in Korea for 5 years and I've been reading the books, so let me save you the history lesson by saying I'm fairly up to speed on things but still find myself amazed, as many do, about the DPRK and their tactics. Title says it all of what use is a nuke when you could've threatened to open the border at any time? edit They've already changed their propaganda since 1994 to say that while they're poor, they're still pure. My point is that a significant portion of the population has already "disappeared" and is working in camps, or is living in isolated communities with minimal contact with major population centers. Fear is their weapon, and they already hold their own population as hostage..as well as their neighbors. It seems like a pretty logical conclusion to me to threaten the neighbors with a major refugee crisis and would achieve massive instability in the south.

Title: Open Letter to President Barack Obama on the Urgent Situation in the Korean Peninsula

March 10, 2013
Content: Open Letter to President Barack Obama on the Urgent Situation in the Korean Peninsula March 10, 2013 Dear President Obama, At this moment, the Korean Peninsula is facing the most serious danger of possible outbreak of war since the Korean War. It is not an exaggeration that the United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 2094 tighter sanctions against North Korea following North Korea s third nuclear weapon testing has brought the matters to hair trigger situation. North Korea, in response, has announced the renouncement of nonaggression agreements between the two sides of Korea and the cessation of the hot line between the two governments. Moreover, North Korea has already declared its abandonment of the Korean War Armistice Agreement starting on March 11, to coincide with the start of the Key Resolve Foal Eagle joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises. All these ominous developments are leading the Korean Peninsula closer to war. Through these years, we have seen that sanctions and pressures against North Korea are not realistic approaches towards peaceful resolution rather they have brought more tension and crisis. All nations -- the U.S., North Korea, South Korea, and the U.N. Security Council member nations will surely want a peaceful resolution and not resort to another war. Indeed, a peaceful resolution is the only viable road for peace and security in the peninsula and the region. We respectfully ask the following First, initiate dialogue with North Korea on the road to peaceful resolution, culminating in theformulation of peace treaty. The replacement of the Korean War armistice agreement with a peace treaty is the only way to move away from the current crisis. You have pursued a policy of strategic patience towards North Korea through these years, but this path has not succeeded. Under current armistice mechanism, this kind of crisis will repeat itself constantly. The only way is to convert temporary armistice to real and lasting peace, guaranteed by a peace treaty. Second, we ask the repeal of the Resolution No. 2094 as it is a catalyst of bringing the Korean Peninsula closer to war. Third, we ask the end of Key Resolve Foal Eagle military exercises. As the cessation of the Team Spirits exercises in 1992 brought about the start of dialog between Washington and Pyongyang, dialog can restart with the end of Key Resolve Foal Eagle exercises.

Title: Is a war with North Korea worth it, despite the massive number of deaths, if it means that ~25 million North Koreans will be liberated and the hundreds of thousands living in labor camps?
Content: Is a war with North Korea worth it, despite the massive number of deaths, if it means that 25 million North Koreans will be liberated and the hundreds of thousands living in labor camps? Every discussion on NK focuses on how we mustn't encourage war because hundreds of thousands will die. However, I can't help but think about it in the context of WW2. I know we America didn't join the war to selflessly stop the Nazis, but when we look back on it, we tend to say "It was worth it to save those that we did" or that "We should have joined earlier, we purposely ignored the Nazis as they killed millions." In that context, I can't help but think that a war with North Korea should happen as soon as possible, and we should obliterate the leadership completely. It's a country of almost 25 million people, and estimates on wikipedia should that about 300,000 people are living in gulags or labor camps. Even here on reddit sorry I don't have a link I've read discussions on how the NK camps are similar to the Nazi camps. What are you thoughts? Is it worth it to lose so many lives in a war if it means saving so many more from the horror that is life in NK, and if it means avoiding nuclear war?

Title: Could a nuclear attack on South Korea be a favorable option for North Korea?
Content: Could a nuclear attack on South Korea be a favorable option for North Korea? I know that there have been too many posts about North Korea but I hope my question brings on some new discussion. Like many people, I've been keeping up with the recent sabre-rattling in the East. Given that most of North Korea's threats have been empty in the past, I don't think the rhetoric will successfully transition into armed conflict. However, a point that I've discussed with several people is the possibility of a nuclear attack on Seoul. Kim Jong Un doesn't seem to have the same kind of fear-induced influence that his father maintained. Making threats against the US helps him create a strong leader image. If he backs out now, I think it is more than likely that North Koreans would lose what little faith they have in their leadership. I think Kim Jong Un must make war to stay in power but he knows any type of traditional military attack is suicide. The most viable option seems to be a nuclear attack. Assuming that North Korea has the capability to launch a nuclear warhead successfully, it won't have too far to travel to cause massive damage to Seoul. I think most people will agree that neither the US nor South Korea will be able to respond quickly enough to intercept the warhead. If you think North Korea will never be able to launch a nuclear weapon, you can stop here. Thanks for reading! So now that North Korea has successfully attacked Seoul, where does that leave us? It is highly unlikely that the world will allow a nuclear retaliation. Both China and Japan risk exposure to added radiation so they would both be against such a response. In addition, our real target, Kim Jong Un and Company, would likely escape the nuclear attack in a heavily fortified bunker while millions of his "happy" citizens perish. How could the US military respond if they don't retaliate with nuclear weapons? Would they try to invade? I think it would be difficult for the US to push north with ground troops... the DMZ has 50 years worth of land mines, the terrain is extremely mountainous, and I'm not sure how supportive the American public will be with the idea of sending US troops to a highly radioactive region. The options left on the table would have to involve China's permission for US military movement through its territory and I don't think China will be too keen on that idea. They are essentially the big brother to North Korea and US involvement would reinforce the image that we are China's big brother. Also, would you be comfortable with the Chinese navy making moves in Key West Not exactly the same situation but it would be so easy for Chinese media to play it up ? At this point, an immediate retaliation seems to be out of the question. Would we have to resort to diplomacy? Assuming North Korea has more than one nuclear weapon, it now has the option to threaten Tokyo. Now we may have a better chance of stopping that attack and North Korea might not even have the chance to launch a second. However, holding Tokyo hostage would be North Korea's best move since it would deter an immediate and aggressive response from the US. If the worst were to happen, the US would be blamed for sucking at diplomacy, even if its impossible to hold a rational conversation with Lil' Kim. In addition, we have to consider the economic impact of a war torn South Korea and Japan. Japan is the number 2 buyer of US bonds so taking them out of the picture would leave an impact on our domestic front. I'm sure I haven't mentioned a number of other harmful effects, including trade disruption and environmental damage. Finally, could China benefit from a worst-case scenario? I don't have enough information on China's role in this situation to ask good questions but if anyone could enlighten me, that would be much appreciated. Is there sufficient cause to worry or are all of my assumptions groundless? Let me know what you guys think!

Title: My Theory for North Korea's First-and-Only Nuclear Attack.
Content: My Theory for North Korea's First-and-Only Nuclear Attack. With all this posturing being done on all sides of their respective fences, I find myself wondering why. Why is North Korea so loud about what its doing and when its planning to do it? unless, it's all a distraction! look at this hand while the other steals your wallet. I'm saying this because all opposition to North Korea say they all have the capability to decimate any surface to air missile launched inside North Korea before it reaches its target. Surely the regime knows this or is at least aware they might not be bluffing. My Theory is simple, North Korea already has deployed its bombs to its target locations throughout the world and simply will detonate them tomorrow. My reasoning for this is two-fold. First, Kim must have seen Trey and Matt's puppet show and simple adopted that strategy as a big F-U to them as they end up being the only target. kim sets off a nuke on their doorstep then tweets "Is is Sirry? no, Not Reary". Second this video If This ends up being Prophacy my fear is that other groups offended by the comedic duo may see it as a sign and start retaliating. God only knows what the Mormons will do.....

Content: N. Korea keeps launching missiles into the ocean but why? It's interesting to me that despite having the capacity to launch missiles at South Korea, Japan, any other nearby countries they wish to, the DPRK is launching them simply into the ocean. Is this not simply a ploy to get the international community to pay attention to them? Why not launch them at people countries? That is what Kim Jong-Un said he wanted to do. I guess I'm just interested in hearing what other Redditors think about this.

Title: Visiting DPRK next month..is there any way this could compromise my future in ROK?
Content: Visiting DPRK next month..is there any way this could compromise my future in ROK? Hey r korea, I applied to visit North Korea on a tour with an NGO called The Pyongyang Project and found out today that I was accepted. I'll be visiting there as well as some Chinese border cities from August 12 to August 24. I am very excited today after hearing this news. I am thrilled that I will get to have such a rare experience. However, my girlfriend citizen of ROK is not so thrilled. She says she will support me no matter what because she loves me and she knows how badly I want to go. However, it is pretty obvious she is apprehensive about the whole thing. Today I sent her a link to Pyongyang Project's website when she asked me to and suddenly she started asking me if I really trust their organization. According to her, their website seems a little too communist-friendly and even looks like it is supportive of the government. I disagree but she still managed to get me a little worried. She implied that if I want to have a future in South Korea which I do--I plan to marry this woman and become a permanent resident one day , I best be careful that I don't get "too deep into this kind of stuff." To me, this sounds a bit silly since I'm just going to be a tourist there--not planning to pledge allegiance to their political philosophy and whatnot. I know I will be monetarily supporting the DPRK but I don't feel that this is something I should feel guilty about. Nor do I think it would really ever cause problems for me in my future in South Korea. But I am not an expert on these matters. Basically, what do you guys think? To me, the Pyongyang Project seems like a pretty legit organization..and as a non-profit much better than most of the other companies offering tours to DPRK. Should I reevaluate though? Is there any merit to what my girlfriend has been saying? Should I be concerned about my future in South Korea? Because as much as I'd love to visit North Korea..my past, present, and future in South Korea are much more important to me. Any advice regarding this would be appreciated. And if you have visited the DPRK before, any advice about the trip would be awesome too! Thanks much, friends.

Title: Japan to intercept any North Korea missile deemed a threat
Content: Japan to intercept any North Korea missile deemed a threat Japan will strike any North Korean ballistic missile that threatens to hit Japan in the coming weeks after Pyongyang recently fired medium-range missiles, a government source said on Saturday. Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera issued the order, which took effect on Thursday and runs through April 25, the day that marks the founding of North Korea's army, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Following the order, meant "to prepare for any additional missile launches," a destroyer was dispatched to the Sea of Japan and will fire if North Korea launches a missile that Tokyo deems in danger of striking or falling on Japanese territory, the source said. Tensions have been building between North Korea and its neighbors since Pyongyang - in an apparent show of defiance - fired two Rodong missiles on March 26, just as the leaders of Japan, South Korea and the United States were sitting down to discuss containing the North Korean nuclear threat. That first firing in four years of mid-range missiles that can hit Japan followed a series of short-range rocket launches over the past two months. The Rodong ballistic missiles fell into the sea after flying 650 km 400 miles , short of a maximum range thought to be some 1,300 km, Japan said. Since then, North Korea has rattled sabres by firing artillery rounds into South Korean waters, prompting the South to fire back South Korea has test-fired a new ballistic missile with a range of 500 km and Pyongyang has threatened an unspecified "new form" of nuclear test. At the same time, Japan and North Korea resumed talks - suspended since Pyongyang test-launched a long-range missile more than a year ago - over the North's nuclear and missile programs, as well as the fate of Japanese abducted in the 1970s and 1980s to help train North Korean spies. Onodera has avoided publicly announcing the new missile-intercept order so as not to put a chill on those talks, Japanese media said. He also did not deploy Patriot missile batteries that would be the last line of Defense against incoming warheads, the source told Reuters. Japanese Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan are equipped with advanced radar equipment able to track multiple targets and carry missiles designed to take out targets at the edge of space.

Title: What I've seen there. 9 days, trying to stay outside Pyongyang as much as I could.
Content: What I've seen there. 9 days, trying to stay outside Pyongyang as much as I could. I'm back home from the DPRK. Amazing experience. I think I've seen a number of things that might interest this sub. I'll try to make a list in this post. In case you want to ask me anything afterwards please do. My tour was 8 days long, then I added one day at the border town of Sinuiju. We were a small group, only 5 plus the western guide and we were cycling. For this reason we saw much of the countryside and also, we were let interact with the locals much more than usual. We've been around Pyongyang, Kaesong, Nampo and Samjiyon paektu and we biked along many villages outside these cities. We were also allowed to do other rare things, like going inside a real DPRK mall probably for the elites... were you paid in KPW and also to a local pub. We changed euros to KPW at the real rate 1 USD 7200 KPW that day . In the hotels and foreigners shops the prices were expressed in some fake Won that was converted to dollars with a 100 1 rate. But koreans could not pay the expressed prices in KPW of course! Fun things, in that mall you could also find some luxury western item, like a bulgari perfume for 950,000 KPW 100 eur! . A bottle of good soju was 2,000 KPW for comparison. So... The drought is bad. Really bad. Most rivers were very dry, just a small stream in the bed. Considering that now it's supposed to be the end of the flood season that's extremely worrying. Nonetheless the crops seemed to be in good enough shape. In some provinces all the fields looked good, in others some of the fields were clearly suffering, but not that much. In the Nampo area south pyongyang province rice was been re-transplanted in a number of fields. In the end this is definitely going to hurt the already bad agriculture. You could see that indeed they planted crops in every single square inch of land. The people all looked fed enough in the visited provinces. That's consistent with recent WFP reports, no surprise. What struck me really a lot was how well dressed everybody was. Like women pushing bikes loaded with enormous bags of materials... in a nice dress!! It didn't make sense. I don't dress that well when I do manual labour! Even the farmers in the fields. Not only in Pyongyang. Everywhere. In Sariwon, in the villages between there and Nampo etc... The high heels thing that was posted one or two months ago is definitely true. I originally dismissed as the usual rumor. But it's true and really impressive. In Pyongyang almost every girl of whatever age has very high heels. In the countryside it was still like 1 in 2. You see more hills there than in Milan during the fashion week!!! I've even seen many girls riding their bikes full of bags pushing the pedals with the front of their feet because they were wearing high heels! Didn't make any sense. The infrastructures are either non-existent or crumbling. Way worse than you can imagine. Bad small dirt roads, no electricity outside Pyongyang, no way to move food, very often no running water etc... You can see everywhere electricity poles with cement crumbling, some already on the ground, some worryingly inclined... The Pyongyang-Sinuiju train had an average speed of 40 km h!! The mausoleum Kumsusan palace of the Sun is way bigger, grander, weirder and more lavish than you expect. Seriously. Whatever your expectations might be it's still more. The locals are extremely friendly and love westerns including american . One day we went to see some waterfalls one hour drive if you have a car... outside Kaesong, and it was a national holiday. It was fully packed with people that came there by old buses or on the back of trucks to party bbq, karaoke and dancing . At the beginning everybody looked at it surprised. Then most of them wanted to take pictures of us on their cameras and kept on taking us to their group. The same happened when we bumped into people in rural places. First they got a "WTF??" look on their face seeing a single western guy we spread quite a bit riding bikes in the middle of the forest there... Then started smiling and waving. References to KJU by the guides were almost not existent in Pyongyang and in most of the tours. He was mentioned like three times in the whole week Some of the banners around mentioned him but that's it . Instead when we went to Sinuiju he was constantly mentioned by the guides. The guides know he studied in Switzerland and when one of us asked about his birth location since they were constantly repeating the birthdate and place of the other Kims he said in a surprised tone "actually we don't know this..." The tourism ... There's a lot of controversy in this sub regarding tourism there. So I'll try to give my impressions regarding what kind of people go there and why, what they're told and how they react. So... Most of the people there were definitely not even NK buffs. They knew very little of the country. Neither of the serious issues except of the obvious basics and, more important, not even of the "pop things" you know... the obligatory Kim's hairstyle etc.. . Most of them were proper travelers those guys that go to every single nation on earth. most people I've talked with, of other groups, then were going to keep on backpacking in many other nations like mongolia, russia or whatever . Many others were normal tourists a stereotypical WASP family with grandma and kids, a very old couple from the UK . Only few were there to see "the country they've read so much about". Also our western guide told us they try to avoid bringing in people that are very spoken against or pro the government . I've also been told that there is a very small but interesting group of people that go there because they're looking for total isolation e.g. they had a guy that was being stalked a couple of months ago . Most of the tourists react in the same way to the propaganda. we had very little of it on our tour, but other people in the hotels from different kind of tours had lots of it . And.... In the evening in the hotel bar everybody LFAO about it. It's so over the top that not a single person buys it. They go there neutral about it and laugh about it directly from the first night! The guides are really guides, no secret police or whatever. They're generally amazing people and are interested about you. If you build a good relationship with them you can hang around with them and talk freely, joke, drink in the pubs etc... Ours were amazing. A guy and a very young girl on her second trip. They were also curious about our lives back home etc... It was amazing in Sinuiju. Less than 100 western people ever went there since it's open. The guides were visibly super-duper excited about finally practicing english and meeting foreigners. They kept asking questions about us, looking at our pictures from homes and so on. Amazing experience in a city with very little to offer for sightseeing... BTW... I made the math and it turns out that tourism can't get the regime any significant amount of money... It's less than 1 M a year business, take away the share of the western companies and you're left with nothing. Also many places they make you see definitely seem like they can't ever make money. they have these giant things with local guides always ready.... waiting for 10 tourists every other day!! In the end... The place was beautiful and the experience really enlightening. Going downhill at 50 km h under a rainstorm on mount Paektu makes you feel as alive as ever! 11 10 would do that again. protip if you go there try to avoid tours that are going to make you spend too much time on the bus keeping on jumping from one Kim's statue to the other. And go to the countryside!

Title: Is another revolution not being televised? Or is it "not" Contradicting reports - some alleging Pyongyang coup, lockdown, others calm and normalcy. Note that long ago, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung faked an announcement of Kim Il Sung's death to expose dissenters.
Content: Is another revolution not being televised? Or is it "not" Contradicting reports - some alleging Pyongyang coup, lockdown, others calm and normalcy. Note that long ago, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung faked an announcement of Kim Il Sung's death to expose dissenters. "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss" - the who "Won't get Fooled Again" who knows what is going on, or even if anything is going on, or if something is going on, whether it represents any change good or bad. Or whether it is the end of - or the beginning of, anything. Gil Scott Heron famously said "The revolution will not be televised" and of course it would never be, quite the opposite, the expected reaction from the media in a state on the verge of revolution could be expected to be more normalcy than is normal until the moment the change had actually come. At that point, who knows. Lets consider this if, as has been frequently proposed, for what I think are credible reasons, Kim Jong Un was never in command, then his vanishing, if indeed that has happened like so many others have vanished previously, could not be described as "change", as it wouldn't offer any reason to hope of improvement in any way. It would just be a continuation of business as usual. ---------- ---------- Also, given the eagerness of outsiders to step in and "restore order" in any truly contested, changing situation, unless the change represented an actual popular revolution, one could not expect to see any outward manifestation of the change besides different faces perhaps if some prominent event happened that demanded some any people to be seen as the face of government. They might be as likely as not, probably more likely than not to be paid actors. What would it gain the government to reveal the true leadership? Nothing. What would it lose then? It would mean that when if there was to be some actual change, that person would get blamed. So, I think the probability of that those person s being not the real leader ship is fairly high. ----------- Former Top Official Says Kim Jong-un Is No Longer in Control of North Korea "Pyongyang Under Lockdown" IBtimes Pyongyang not under lockdown, city sources say Telegraph claim that Pyongyang is "under lockdown" inaccurate, Pyongyang sources say

Title: With the strange absence of Kim Jong Un, I got to thinking
Content: With the strange absence of Kim Jong Un, I got to thinking After few drinks of course. I had this moment of clarity about him, I don't want to call it sympathy, because that is the last thing I could have for a person like that. But, it goes like this imagine you are the ruler of a land. You can do anything you want, have nearly anything you want and have servants around you at all times. You live the most luxurious of lives and basically any wish can be your command. You have it all it seems. There is a caveat however. You can never leave. You are stuck. You know of the outside world, and all the beauties it holds. But even with all your money and "power" you cannot get to those places. How do you think that would make a person feel? Knowing that there is all of this wonderment and excitement about the world, and you can't go. And, yes, I know he went away to boarding school. But do you think Switzerland would let him back in now?

So my grandfather is a korean war veteran, fyi he's also korean , and he lives in korea boohoo I live in meeguk . He was part of a south korean military unit in 1950-1953 in Inchon that worked very closely, under the american military joint unit force . My grandfather was also in some command position with authority over 100 men. The unit itself was made up of paratroopers yay, my gf jumped outta airplanes and shot commies . They worked under the U.S. military, sorta like KATUSA, but my dad said my gf wasn't. He said my gf was in something along the lines of "Roca pronounced this way, not correct spelling ". So with this info, could you guys possibly tell me which unit battalion or military division he was a part of, I'd be real grateful. ALSO my dad is going to contact my gf about this later, and I have to ask questions for an interview. So if any of you have any questions, AMA.

Title: Architecture of Pyongyang
Content: Architecture of Pyongyang Hey! I've always been really interested in architecture and the architecture of Pyongyang has been a special curiosity of mine, so I thought I would finally open a post on this topic. I really admire the way the whole city is done. Unlike cities in Europe that have formed over time, Pyongyang was completely planned. It's actually a model example of a planned city. Pyongyang was destroyed after the Korean war and was built again to be the "model socialist city" as said by Kim Il Sung. There are lots of huge monuments, wide streets and many large spaces. Personally I really like the large open areas, as there aren't really that many of those in European capitals. I've gathered some highlights here Tower Of Juche Picture 1 Picture 2 New apartments on the Changjon street Picture 1 Picture 2 Picture 3 Kim Il Sung square Picture 1 Picture 2 Mansudae Grand Monument Picture 1 Picture 2 Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery Picture 1 Picture 2 Kumsusan Palace of the sun Picture 1 Monument to the foundation of the workers' party Picture 1 If you know any other great buildings, post them to the comments. Also if you know any other cities in the world that have similar architecture, discussion about those is also welcome.

Content: As they can't supply the name of a nation that "wins" the title besides themselves, answering Obama's rhetorical question proposing that the DPRK is "the most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on Earth", while attempting to change the subject shows they know they are. They were trying to divert the attention of the reader. Now I don't know the official rules of debate, but even I can see this is a shameless attempt to change the subject as even the DPRK's debate propaganda team must see that clearly is true. So, they try to change the subject. However, look at their choice of words!. "The recent wild remarks made by Obama are nothing but a poor grumble of a loser driven into a tight corner in the all-out stand-off with the DPRK ," the ministry's unnamed spokesman told the Korean Central News Agency. "This is little short of admitting himself subject change 1 that the U.S. lacks ability to stifle the DPRK completely different, irrelevant to question and 2. that a military option is not workable." This is another completely different issue, again not an answer to and is irrelevant to the important question. Also, let me point out that by proposing his rhetorical question, Obama, and by extension the US, is trying to solve the big problem peacefully by showing them evidence of their inability to be part of the community of nations- i.e. their isolating themselves shows that they know they cannot win by strength of their system, that they know their arguments are so weak they must isolate themselves and attach a truly ridiculous and pitiful divinity to their "leaders" family, a fake divinity that even they are tiring of, who we must point out rule by terrifying their people, not by consent of the governed. But to return to the key point. Since the DPRK proposed Obama in that context of winning and losing, they need to stick to the question they claimed he lost. They changed to subject to divert us from realizing that there, it ts quite fair to say they did indeed lose the question as they clearly did not have an alternative "winning" NATION apart from themselves . If Obama is a loser, they are admitting OTHER NATIONS lose on "most isolated, the most sanctioned, the most cut-off nation on Earth" - ness. Congratulations, DPRK! You win, you are the most isolated. ________________ noun 1. a question asked solely to produce an effect or to make an assertion and not to elicit a reply, as What is so rare as a day in June? . -------

Title: Nuclear Reactor Infrastructure in North Korea
Content: Nuclear Reactor Infrastructure in North Korea I'm taking a class on North Korea right now, and I've come across some mentions of smaller Soviet-made Nuclear reactors in the country specifically in The Real North Korea by Andrei Lankov . I was wondering Are the scientists working at these reactors as sheltered from the rest of the world as the rest of the North Korean people? If they are, do they use the reactors as-is, repairing them to the original working capacity over and over? Or do the scientists have special access to the scientific community, in order to keep NK on the "cutting edge" of nuclear technology information, if not ability? I've read about manufacturing facilities which have run out of supply of equipment or have had machines break where the workers will innovate to fix the machine in an unconventional way, or will update it with their own innovations. Is this possible to do to a 70s-era reactor? I know little about the science, doing research now , but I have to think that the scientists that work with these machines have to have made some observations innovations in the years the items have been in the country. Could it be that scientists there have used the nuclear reactors to advance the country's technological knowledge without outside help? To use a pop culture example, the way Transformers are reverse-engineered to inform technology advances This book is very informative, however now 2015 parts seem a little outdated. It is also very obviously biased pro-American, though that's a trend I've seen in most books on the DPRK I've read so far. TL DR Do North Korean nuclear scientists work in a bubble, or do they have access to the world of peer-reviewed professional Nuclear science? Is it possible they could develop a next gen reactor, simply by reverse engineering Soviet-made reactors, then working forwards from there?

I couldn't help but remember the vicious lies spread by the media claiming that the disabled were 'disappeared' Yet again the Western news has been shown up for what it is, a dossier of lies.

Content: I have a question Are everyday North Koreans aware of the provision of food to the North by entities like the US, South Korea, Japan, etc. by means of the WFP? If so, what do they tell people are the reasons its given? Obviously, we would not give them food if we were starving ourselves, or if we wanted to take over NK. The situation seems quite hard to explain within the framework of NK's very particular cosmology. What do they tell people who are involved in the WFP, and what do they tell people who see the sacks of rice emblazoned with "this is a gift of the people of".. the US, South Korea, Japan etc.

This will be worse than Japan sneaking up Hawaii in 1941. Keep in mind, North Korea has nothing to lose. They produce NOTHING for the world. Unlike every other nation that has nuclear weapons, North Korea is the only that makes threats of using nukes for pretty much no reason at all. South Korea has Samsung, Hyundai, and about a hundred other successful companies that provide to the world. North Korea has nothing. But they now have nuclear weapons mounted on a sub. Think about this hard. Nothing good is going to come out of N.K. having nuclear subs.

Title: CMV: If Unification occurs on the Korean Peninsula, it's only going to spell disaster for Korean/Japanese relations.
Content: CMV If Unification occurs on the Korean Peninsula, it's only going to spell disaster for Korean Japanese relations. A thought occurred to me recently as I was reviewing my experiences concerning the present state of relations between these three peoples. I'm not happy about it, as I believed for a time that Unification was the most peaceful solution for the Korean people. But, what's good for the Korean people can be disastrous for her neighbors. Some thoughts a There are a lot of Korean cultural expressions in use today in South Korea that denigrate the Japanese. A lot of them are spoken as much today as they were 60 years ago. b The discussions I've had with students of military age don't talk so much about a DPRK strategy. Ever since Dokdo, if you want to get a rise out of a man aged 18-34, forget about the DPRK. Talk Japan. That's where the true rage is. Some people have told me that this is what happens in the military colleges, too, at least at a philosophical level. c I've worked in a number of schools where a few of the children were indoctrinated at a young age to fear and hate the Japanese. Passionately. I'm not alone here, many of us have. Now. I am NOT saying that South Korea is arming itself. I am NOT saying that South Korea is a hostile nation. I'm not saying anything at all to that extent. I'm saying that when you combine the two Koreas, the average of Lukewarm Hate and White-hot Hate is still Red Hot Hate. How can anyone in good conscience support Reunification, if what it means for East Asia is more tension?

This is an example of what I'm looking for. Generally current news would be preferred, but I'm basically just looking for anything that will help give an idea of the general political atmosphere of NK and how it ties in to the culture and economy. It's a ten-page paper so I'm really looking to cover everything, but especially the recent droughts and possible diplomatic negotiations, and how the current regime might be transforming in any way. Thanks in advance!

Title: Why doesn't South Korea have a notable missile defense system, like Israel's Iron Dome?
Content: Why doesn't South Korea have a notable missile defense system, like Israel's Iron Dome? Something like a projectile interception system to shoot down incoming threats from North Korea. Something that would destroy airborne rockets and mortars from the North so that the South is unable to be affected by such threats. Incidents like yesterday could have been easily prevented with an air defense system like the Iron Dome or the Patriot Air and Defense system. The South is more than capable economically, logistically, and militarily to install and use these technologies to defend against incoming North Korean threat. In fact, aren't missiles and mortars the only things threatening the South? Because there is no way in hell the North would send actual troops and vehicles unless they are trying to commit suicide. Considering that Seoul, the heart of South Korea, is basically a sitting duck to such threats, how is it possible that there's nothing to stop them? Obviously, the joint U.S and South Korean forces is more than capable of completely annihilating North Korean forces if it came to war. Actually, I'm sure South Korea alone would be more than enough to handle North Korea. But what I don't understand is how a developed country like South Korea that is facing perpetual imminent threat has no means to directly counter it.

Content: Where role does South Korea play in US-China relations? Isn't it basically Japan a historical ally during the Cold War with US troops stationed , except that it would be a lot more costly for the US to keep in its sphere of influence? What keeps the US from 'abandoning' SK when push comes to shove? If I could push the question a little bit further, is their a difference between the way that South Korea and Japan were 'used' by the US for containing the power of the Soviet Union, and the way that they could 'used' for containing the power of China? I'm not suggesting, by the way, that Japan and South Korea are somehow puppet states of the US. They are both democratic states with their own agendas. But I'm just wondering how they fit in US foreign policy, since they are both developed and technologically advanced states in East Asia.

Title: How does China's geopolitical position benefit from a nuclear North Korea?
Content: How does China's geopolitical position benefit from a nuclear North Korea? It's important to point out that not all countries have an extreme aversion to nuclear proliferation. China literally gave a working, MRBM-mountable nuclear weapon design to Pakistan in the 1970s, so I think we should throw out the hyper-realist idea that "China would never assist another nation in nuclear proliferation" out right from the start. China also runs diplomatic interference on the international scene for Iran and North Korea's proliferation efforts, and resists efforts to crack down on either nation. How does China's geopolitical position benefit from a nuclear North Korea? Does a nuclear North Korea limit the U.S.' strategic freedom of action? Maybe China sees the divided Korean peninsula as an analogue to its division with Taiwan? Perhaps China wants North Korea to have the ultimate nuclear defense against regime change while it purchases North Korean minerals at a steep discount to develop the poor Northeastern China region? What do you think?

We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners. While we cannot confirm these claims at this time, we condemn any violation of UN Security Council Resolutions and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006 and, until today, has done so twice since, but we have consistently made clear that we will not accept it as a nuclear state. We will continue to protect and defend our allies in the region, including the Republic of Korea, and will respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations.

Content: Could South Korea tolerate the bombardment of Seoul in order to invade North Korea? This Capspian Report video discusses the idea that if the North were to shell Seoul then South Korea may be willing to tolerate the bombardment and possible destruction of the city to attempt an invasion of North Korea and overthrow the regime. How plausible a strategy is this? Could such an invasion be organised within a short period of time? Could any such invasion be successful? What damage could be done to Seoul? EDIT detail

Title: Estimated number of South Korean civilian deaths if North Korea decided to attack?
Content: Estimated number of South Korean civilian deaths if North Korea decided to attack? I'm just curious about what some people think the true number of South Korean causalities would be if North Korea decided to legitimately pour it on. I'm also curious, if North Korea suddenly decided to launch an attack on thousands millions of civilians in South Korea let's say they suddenly kill 10,000 -- what would the global response be? Would Russia and China actually let the US and South Korea respond appropriately, or would they continue to support such a regime? Thanks a lot for helping to answer my questions, I know it's they're basically fairly-tale level but I still appreciate it. It just blows my mind that a government regime of this nature can exist in the 21st century.

Title: Another Nuclear test by the DPRK could trigger a "Millennium Eruption" of a south-chinese stratovolcano(Changbaishan)
Content: Another Nuclear test by the DPRK could trigger a "Millennium Eruption" of a south-chinese stratovolcano Changbaishan This thread found in r science is as an intro "The internal pressure in a magma chamber can be influenced by a dynamic stress change as well as lithostatic stress field28. Previous UNE tests have shown that detonation strength can be greater than M7.029. Large UNEs may produce strong seismic waves over local and regional distances. Dynamic stress changes induced by transient seismic waves can overpressurize the magma and trigger volcanic eruption30,31,32,33." UNE Underground Nuclear Explosion. A millenium eruption is classified as one that only occurs once every 1 thousand years and has some strong implications on its immediate and surrounding 1500KM away area. as is noted in my reply to the above thread, shows that there would be 5Cm of ash over areas as far away as Hokkaido, Japan and 10CM of ash in Vladivostok, Russia.

Title: One short story --- A part of Korean literature about Korean war
Content: One short story --- A part of Korean literature about Korean war A man who had conceived a 6 month year old baby with his wife, is helping with farm work for his cousin, a tenant farmer. One day, on his way to downtown to sell crops, he suddenly hears a whistle and is taken by soldiers without reason. When he enters, there was a group of soldiers wearing military uniform and gunstock. As time goes by, the man, now covered with blood, falls down from hunger and lack of energy, and is taken somewhere. With a faint consciousness, he helps himself up and turns around. In a black jail there are some soldiers wearing the same military uniform and talking to each other. He hears that this place is the Soviet s prison camp. He worries for his family, wife and son s life. However, his life in the prison camp is just as unpromising, as he waits for the end of the war. One day, the morning has an unusual mood. A white soldier wearing another military uniform is talking to a Soviet. The man hears a whistle sound. Immediately after that sound, an order is issued. The prisoner soldiers are gathered to sit in a huddle under the surface of a wall. The man hears from an interpreter what the Soviet had said. It was about the Geneva Conventions and the American soldiers, but still very difficult to fully understand. The Soviet continues talking. "The two sides agreed to a truce. Under the Military Demarcation Line, Korea was divided into two parts under the North Korean government and the South Korean government. Here is a line. If you are on right side, you'll go to the North part. If you are on left side, you'll go to the South part. We give ten minutes. " Hearing this order, everyone stiffened. At first, everyone waited with baited breath to know what happened. Five minutes passed and a few people came and went as though they all waited together. They crossed between the line again and again. At first, the man sat in a seat to the north. He was born in Pyeongyang. Even though he imagined his parents waiting for him, he was haunted by a small village in the south, a new base, where lived his wife and six month old son and his cousin. So then he moved to the south, trembling. He did not know which side he belonged to. A whistle sounded. The man tensed as though his head was had been hit by a blunt weapon. That line was not a simple line but the 38th parallel. What has he to do with this? The pupil raised his head and steadied his breath. He saw a pale object walk stealthily down the corridor. A white rat rustled his tail and walked toward the south. He chose the south. Perhaps the white rat was a phantom. It was maybe a sound of the whistle and an ideology impressed upon the cruelly small lives of the people. - Realistic novel by Kim Sojin Catching rats

Content: Does Kim Jong-un believe himself? Even with the poor intelligence capabilities of DPRK, he has to know how vastly superior the USA military force it, right? I mean, he has the internet. So, he can't possibly think he could win a fight against us? He has to know he is a shitty leader running a shitty country. So is the threats all just a front to not lose control? If he accepted aid, he would have to admit at least in some way to his people that he is failing them, and he can't do that and risk losing control. Also, he can't let too many people in the country in case he is actually committing human rights violations. But he takes the act so far that sanctions are increased against him, and it makes life even harder. So what's the deal? Does he really actually somehow think that he is the best?

One of the motivators of NK to keep their nuclear program is that they can sell knowledge and technology to other countries and use the funds to prop up the regime. NK has been accused of selling nuclear technology or information to Myanmar, Syria, Libya, Iran. Are they selling to Saudi Arabia? I read that SA may want a nuke to counterbalance Iran and Israel having them. So is NK helping SA build a nuclear weapon? Is NK at the point where they can sell finished nuclear weapons to foreign nations instead of just the knowhow?

Title: North Korean government launches propaganda war against North Korean defectors
Content: North Korean government launches propaganda war against North Korean defectors North Korean government is waging a propaganda war against North Korean defectors activists in South Korea, using their families left behind in North Korea. The families are shown, badmouthing the defectors and portraying them as untrustworthy liars and criminals who betrayed their fatherland by fleeing punishment for common crimes. This clip was uploaded by North Korea to Youtube, attacking the credibility of Kim Yong Hwa, a well known long time North Korean defector who defected in 1999, and has since worked towards informing the North Korean human rights abuses in South Korea. If you watch this clip and forward to 6 25, it shows the scene of Kim giving testimony on the popular Channel-A show, "On my way to meet you", a trail blazing show which started in 2012, it was the first talk show in Korea to show the real state of North Korea using panelists made entirely out of North Korean defectors. The show is being broadly watched in South Korea, as well as from abroad. North Korea's propaganda attacks show what kind of negative effect this TV show and others like it has had on North Korean government who are obviously keeping a very close watch on the South Korean popular media. Many of the defectors have had their lives threatened by anonymous death threat notes sent to their mailboxes, emails, and phone calls all coming from inside South Korea. For many of North Korean defectors, South Korea is unsafe.

Title: What's that fairly-new TV show that took place in Gaeseong (Kaesong) in 1950, then showed the start of the Korean War?
Content: What's that fairly-new TV show that took place in Gaeseong Kaesong in 1950, then showed the start of the Korean War? At my parents' house, I saw my mother watching a new TV show through satellite TV and a Korean subscription package and she told me that the show takes place in Gaeseong in 1950, just before the Korean War started. Then later in the episode, bombings happened and the residents started evacuating south. In the countryside, most of the evacuees were walkers but there were a couple of vehicles - a truck carrying a coffin and belongings, and a CADILLAC. Who could've afforded a Cadillac in 1950 Korea??? I never got the show's title. If what I told you rings a bell, please share the title. Also, do you have a link to where I can watch this show online preferably with English subtitles? Thanks.

Title: Hello /r/NorthKorea. In this post I have hundreds of pictures from my 8-day visit to the DPRK that I would like to share with this sub!
Content: Hello r NorthKorea. In this post I have hundreds of pictures from my 8-day visit to the DPRK that I would like to share with this sub! Hello everyone! In my recent trip to the DPRK I saw and did a lot of really one-of-a-kind things. Everyone here on this sub is here for different reasons but at the core, I think a lot of us are just really intrigued by this hermit nation. Over the course of my 8 days in North Korea I took a lot of pictures that I think a lot of people would be interested to see I spoke to the mods a while ago about making a post here and have spent a lot of time uploading, sorting, and putting this together, so I hope it is fascinating and welcomed by everybody I have all my pictures arranged into relevant Imgur albums below. Of course I welcome all comments and questions from everybody, I would be very happy to explain things and talk about the pictures below Without further ado here we go. _________________ Miscellaneous things around the city of Pyongyang This album is the catch-all for everything I saw just exploring the city. Almost all of these were taken from the bumpy tour bus as that's how we went everywhere, but they still look good. Lots of buildings, lots of streets, which in most places aren't very interesting but this isn't exactly like most places. This album has by far the most pics The highlights such as these are spread throughout Pyongyang skyline views Reunification Arch Pyongyang Train Station Arch of Triumph Worker's Party Monument Ryugyong Hotel the big pointy scary building Buses, trams and streets Bridges and towers Big scary party buildings right out of a dystopian hellscape and quite a lot more. Peruse at your leisure Propaganda These are all the propaganda photos I got from the country. Mostly these are giant billboards up around the street, some of my favorites include Kim Jong-Il standing proudly in front of ostriches, national monuments painted onto ostrich eggs, and my accidental Hitler picture. At the end of the album is the hand-painted propaganda poster I bought, and all the postcards I got as well. North Korean countryside These were mostly taken on the very long drive between Pyongyang and Kaesong at the DMZ, in which we also stopped at a city called Sariwon. Lots of nice scenery and little huts out in the middle of nowhere, and sometimes you see a lone person walking down the highway in which there was just nothing for hundreds of miles. Photos from the DMZ at Kaesong This is everything they allowed me to photograph at the world's most secure border. Being that we approached it from the "other" side compared to most people, we had a very unique look, including the buildings in which the Armistice treaty was signed. "The Americans were ashamed and wanted to have the signing in a makeshift tent, but we wanted to celebrate our victory so we built these glorious buildings in five days". Also photographed is the border with South Korea and the little blue buildings in between, they didn't let us bring cameras in there though. Koryo History Museum in Kaesong Most of the stuff we saw here was the history of ancient Korea, their development and such. Being the split with the south is relatively recent in the grand scheme of their history, there's not really any YAY DPRK stuff in here but it was interesting still. Around the town of Kaesong All the stuff we saw in the border town, mostly residential stuff. I got a picture of a traditional meal including the shockingly delicious dog soup. Sleep tight pupper Around the town of Sariwon In between Kaesong and Pyongyang is Sariwon, which was quite lovely. The middle of the town has a big scenic hill you can walk up and see the city from above. Also there was a water spitting dragon and a rollerblading horse. Grand People's Study House A massive, traditional-looking building for the students of Pyongyang to use to further their studies. Has a beautiful courtyard and a view of the giant Kim statues. Mansu Hill Grand Monument - Giant Bronze Statues The giant 22-meter tall statues of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il. Absolutely surreal place, from a distance you don't even get a sense of the statues until you see the tiny little people at the feet. We were also standing in front of thousands of Koreans paying their respects. WesternPrivilege Pyongyang Metro Station The extremely deep underground rail system that serves 500,000 Koreans a day. Lots of nationalist murals, old trains from East Berlin, and a statue or two. Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum Unfortunately cameras weren't allowed inside, as this was probably my favorite part of the trip. An hour and a half of being spoonfed the exaggerated atrocities of the United States on the poor innocent revolutionaries of Kim Il-Sung. Outside, though, there was still a lot to see, such as all the captured American tanks and weapons. USS Pueblo The only still-captured US naval ship in the world. It's located right at the previously mentioned war museum, you get to go onboard and watch a documentary about why America is bad and why this ship was an act of war and yadda yadda. Objectively America was kind of in the wrong on this one, we were spying on them and claimed not to be. Meh _ ツ _ Mansudae Art Studio A place where North Korea's best artists make their works to glorify the regime. Includes giant statues of the Kims riding horses, a Donald Trump bird, and the DPRK's top artist who has been to something like 25 countries to show his work. Juche Tower The giant flame-tipped tower on the Taedong River, to commemorate Kim Il-Sung's Juche idea which forms the basis of North Korean culture. At the base it is covered in plaques from just about every country in the world, and yes, even America. From the top you see stunning views of Pyongyang even though the weather was a bit gloomy during my visit. Birthplace of Kim Il-Sung The birthplace and childhood home of the DPRK's first leader. Just some humble little huts outside Pyongyang. Mangyongdae Children's Palace A ridiculously ornate, by anyone's standards, building for the bright youth of North Korea. You know, the 3 year olds you see on YouTube playing guitar in unison and such. Photos of the palace, and of the really mind blowing performance by hundreds of kids at the end, all dancing and smiling and singing in front of videos of missile launches and an exploding United States. Chollima Industrial Steel Complex The most productive steel factory in Korea. As with literally every other building, it has a museum attached to it with the accomplishments of the Kims. You can see the steel being made, and then a tour of the full amentities including an obviously fake swimming pool for the workers. Pyongyang Circus On May 1st, International Workers Day, we went to see a circus in the city. Photography was limited but I got some cool pictures nonetheless, and the performance was quite nice. Countryside from Pyongyang to Nampo This is probably the gloomiest of pictures from my trip, and what I use to say that the government didn't regulate 100 of the trip. A lot, yeah, but not everything. On the way here we saw some really decrepit huts and very obviously poor and malnourished people on the side of the road, it was quite sad. The roads were so bad, and the bus was so bumpy, I missed out on a lot of photos but what I've got is acceptable. They get better towards the end. Nampo Dam A "glimmering beacon of socialism", we got to see a giant sea barrage built to control the river near Nampo, which is way out in the countryside. Elementary School outside Pyongyang We got to see first hand the type of place North Korea "educates" its children in. Some pretty disturbing pro-military, anti-US things, the worst of which being photos of corpses on the walls with the blame laid to the Americans. Bit much for toddlers. Farm near school Near that school there was a very small farm, of course with museums and statues and the like. High school in Pyongyang Here we got to see some older students, playing soccer outside, putting on a concert for us and we even got to lead a short English lesson. Kim Il-Sung Square The famed center of Pyongyang, where you see all the parades and nukes on tanks driving through the streets. We were almost not allowed onto the square because there were practices for the upcoming party congress, but we made it anyway. Kumsusan Palace of the Sun At the pre-tour meeting in Beijing we were told that we wouldn't be able to visit the mausoleum of the Kims due to upcoming renovations. We ended up being the last foreign group allowed into the palace for months, which I am so thankful for because this was by far one of the best parts of the trip. The entire affair lasted hours and was honestly a really tense time. We had to 100 of the time be on our guard to pay the utmost of respect to the Dear Leaders. Absolutely no hands behind our backs, or folded in front of us, we had to line up in rows and pay our respects to the Kims. It was an absolutely surreal experience and I would have been so disappointed had we not gone. I also included some Google images of the bodies because obviously, no cameras. Mt. Taesong Amusement Park Directly after the Palace of the Sun we went to an amusement park which was an interesting change of pace. We got to see a lot of Koreans celebrating and having fun on their holiday. A park in Pyongyang on May Day Shortly after lunch and with time to spare to other activities, we got our Korean guides to take us on a nice walk in a popular park in the city. We saw hundreds of people having picnics for their day off, it was quite a nice impromptu stroll. Another farm I've seen articles written about this farm, much bigger and nicer than the other we saw. Complete with employee housing and all the perks. Propaganda posters too! Kaeson Youth Park We got to go to another amusement park, this one more ride-centric than the others. Quite a bit of fun, I didn't go on any rides cause I'm a pussy but everyone had a nice time. Pyongyang Ostrich Farm This was a first time visit even for the owner of the tour company, who was my guide. I believe it was recently opened to tourists and it was honestly kind of hilarious having the Koreans brag about how wonderful their ostriches are. Highlights include a giant mural of Kim Jong-Il standing with ostriches, and propaganda painted eggs. Our trip to the Cinema Another first for the tour organizers, we were allowed into a movie theater in Pyongyang which evidenced that all the lights were off and nobody was there, it was safe to say it was a special screening . We saw a 20-ish year old movie called O Youth, in which a 30 year old man gets pressured by his family to finally get married. He has 5 younger sisters, all athletes to their mother's dismay , and he falls in love with a girl who ends up also being an athlete, even though the mother would prefer she have a more traditionally feminine occupation. The comedy style was really dry, and pro-DPRK language of course filled the movie. Somehow the tour managers even organized one of the actresses to come to the screening with us, and we got to meet her and have a translated Q A. Pyongyang Film Studio In a fitting follow-up, we got to see where a lot of North Korean films are made. There were mini-towns meant to serve as backdrops of old-time Korea both North and South , China, Japan, and even some European scenery. There were some pretty badass propaganda murals and statues as well. The newly built Science Center Newly built, this place was absolutely badass. The buildings are shaped to make a giant atom, and this place is state of the art for any country, much less North Korea. It features a real I mean it's probably empty but still giant missile in the middle of the complex, and towards the end of my pictures there's a story about how we met hundreds of representatives of the Worker's Party Congress that took place a few days later. North Korean Shooting Range I got to release my inner-American here, we got to go to a gun range and fire some real North Korean weapons. Including, a pistol donated to the range by Marshal Kim Jong-Un himself. Absolutely badass. Soccer with North Korean students outside May Day Stadium I was hoping we'd be able to enter the stadium but instead we were directly outside it, and we got to have a westerners-vs-Koreans soccer match with some 13 year old girls yeah they really are girls . They kicked our asses but it was a fun time. Air Koryo and Pyongyang Airport And to wrap up my time in the DPRK, here's photos from when I landed and departed out of Pyongyang International Airport. Yeah the one Kim had the guy killed over, or something. I don't see why, I thought it was a nice airport! Pyongyang Times Issue 2895, April 16th 2016 I was able to get my hands on three consecutive copies of the Pyongyang Times, North Korea's main newspaper in English. They're really fantastic reads and I highly recommend them. This was the first one I saw, I love how they feel the need to have a front-page article reminding everyone that the guy who died 22 years ago "is still the eternal president". Pyongyang Times Issue 2896, April 23rd 2016 This one is a bit more based on the recent economic growth of the DPRK, my favorite of course is the full-page article "analyzing the US and its followers' anti-DPRK rhetoric". Pyongyang Times Issue 2897, April 30th 2016 This paper is really interesting for one reason to me. Two days before the release of this paper is when I arrived into the DPRK. At around 7 30pm that night when I got up to my hotel room in the Yanggakdo Hotel, I turned on the TV and flipped through the channels and Al Jazeera was one of them. I was greeted with the report that North Korea had just had a missile launch failure, and I thought it was really funny that my first news arriving into the DPRK was a western report on their missile failure. Two days later upon the release of this paper, I was not-so-surprised to see the headline "Kim Jong Un oversees SLBM test fire", and an article calling the launch a success. Oh North Korea you rapscallions. Korean newspapers, magazines and other stuff I also got my hands on some Korean-language newspapers but obviously I can't quite read them. If anyone here speaks fluent Korean and is genuinely interested I can send some photos for you to read. I also got some magazines on the plane out of the country one of which in Chinese, whoops and I've got some pictures of the Korean money that I smuggled out. ___________________________ And with that, those are all my stories and pictures from North Korea! As mentioned before, all questions, comments, and anything else are very welcome and I'm happy to share this with all of you

Is if in the future there is a weaker United States and more powerful China. Could China and would China just occupy North Korea and never hand it back to the South? Would South Korea or any of the other Asian countries be able to stop China from doing something like this on their own? You all seem a lot more knowledgeable in these subjects than I do and want to hear your guy's takes. 3

Ever since I learned Kim Jong-un ordered his athletes to come back with 5 gold medals I've been closely following their medal count. Now the olympics are over and they only won 2 golds though they did get 7 total . Will anything happen to the athletes as result?

Content: What would happen if the US pulled out of South Korea? Under what circumstances would it be viable to leave the countries on their own with confidence they wont go to war or have relations go furter south? With SK, first issue obviously is what North Korea would do. Would it bully SK into a corner with nuclear blackmail? Would a pullout provoke SK into building its own nuclear arms as to level the playing field? What Trump has proposed in the past is a pullout of both SK and Japan, would such an action make the region more insecure and or lead to proliferation of nuclear arms? Could diplomatic efforts between all sides set up the framework for US withdrawl?

Title: A package post marked Pyongyang
Content: A package post marked Pyongyang Good Evening, I am new to this sub! I would like to share my communication with the DPRK notably the Propaganda department "Radio and Television" As an avid listener of Shortwave Radio I am used to hearing the various broadcasts from the Voice of Korea. They broadcast in many languages including English. I thought it was time to write a hand written letter to request a QSL card A QSL card is a card from a station, or operator confirming correct reception of listening to the said station After listening and writing down for a full hour of their English language service which includes their greetings to the Great Leader, followed by a segment of which the Great Leader sends his regards to countries around the world. It is then followed by a news segment with the usual derogatory and snide comments to the "South Korean Puppets" and "US Imperialists" during this segment they are always informing listeners of Juche, and it's values and their victories against the US with mentions of the USS Pueblo. It is then followed by revolutionary music or if they are feeling friendly with traditional music, but they are all dedicated to the Great Leader. After compiling my letter to the DPRK, and posting it through my local post office. I asked the clerk the question "Will this get to North Korea?" She said it would! It filled me with some confidence that I would get some direct correspondence from North Korea. 3 months later, and I see a large brown envelope sitting on the bottom of my floor. I picked it, and seen a post mark saying "Pyongyang" after inspecting the package, it had been obviously opened which I am presuming was from the security services of my country. I opened the package and found lots of information, including a letter written back thanking me for listening, and if I would care to answer some trivia questions on the history of the DPRK. I am not sure what the prize will be! It never said! Also included was a copy of the infamous Pyongyang Times in English. I did observe the date mentioned a Juche year instead of the normal format of a year, and date. This was full of what was happening in the DPRK, and the "sworn enemies" I also got a book which was about the Juchue values, and how we around the world should more or less adapt to this ideal! I have not had the chance to read it but I will and report back here with the details of it. I also got a magazine called "Korea today" which was more or less propaganda to entice someone to North Korea on a permanent basis instead of visiting. It really glorifies the country, and I have to be honest in writing this... it really sold the country to me. However, I do realise it's all propaganda! Finally, I received a badge in a colour of the purple in the DPRK flag showing the two Korea's united. I thought I would share my story about the package I got from the DPRK. Thanks for reading and comments are very welcome! Jordan

Title: Should we let Kim Jong Un off the hook?
Content: Should we let Kim Jong Un off the hook? My friend often tells me the best way to handle North Korea is to offer Kim a lifetime vacation, in exchange for stepping down and opening his country to the world. I have always felt that this is a ridiculous strategy because Kim would never accept it, and it is an affront to morality. Why should Kim be allowed to walk away free? My friend says that the longer we wait, the more people will suffer, the bigger the North Korean nuclear arsenal shall grow, and so on. He claims that we must offer the North Korean leadership a free pass as long as they give up power. Millions would be saved if only we would let the Dear Leader get away with his crimes. I told him it would be evil to reward Kim with a lifetime vacation for the suffering of his people, my friend says yeah, but Kim is only one man and it would be worth it to let him go if he gave up his nation. I am very curious to see what people on this sub have to say about it.

I can understand that they don't want the regime to fall because it could lead to a huge influx of refugees and it allows them to have a buffer state in between them and U.S. military forces but it seems to me that they could just stage a coup and replace the North Korean regime with one that is not as stupid essentially one that is similar to theirs . Or am I just misjudging how much power they actually have to do something like that?

Title: Question about North Korea resources
Content: Question about North Korea resources How come does North Korea have the resources needed for a nuclear program? I mean financially, but also logistical, like uranium ore and processing facilities. Iran is a richer and technically advanced country and they didn't manage to detonate a single nuclear bomb, yet North Korea, where word is people are actually starving, managed to have 5 tests already. And they have a rocket program, not very advanced, but still. Do they have uranium mines? Do they buy the nuclear material and technology from the black market? Does other states secretly supports North Korea with manpower and know-how?

Content: DPRK experts, former visitors and Talbukja What is the ultimate no-no when visiting the DPRK? My inspiration for this question was when the Americans were asked this. I guess if any North Koreans are here, you must be FORMER North Koreans who have resettled in the South or America or elsewhere. Last I heard, internet access is hella RARE in your country. Apparently you use an int ra net instead, if you're an averagely-privileged common citizen. So former North Koreans Please share this advice for future tourists looking to visit someday. Same to you, former tourists and journalists to the DPRK, as well as DPRK experts! BTW, will there be special rules for American tourists, particularly those of Japanese and Korean descent?

Title: What will happen when North Korea successfully develop their nuclear tipped missiles
Content: What will happen when North Korea successfully develop their nuclear tipped missiles - North Korea will use the weapons to blackmail S.Korea for money. - North Korea will create small military clashes like shooting torpedoes at S.Korean navy, or blasting border towns with artillery, without fear of S.Korean counter attack. - South Korea will be much more reluctant to retaliate, due to the fear of the clashes escalating into a full blown nuclear attack. - South Korea's entire list of very expensive conventional weapons become useless and meaningless. - North Korea will use the nuclear threats to manipulate the South Korean press and the South Korean political groups that are sympathetic to North Korea. The manipulated groups will demand capitulation of South Korean hardline positions towards North Korea, using the South Korean public's fear of a nuclear attack. - Peace negotiations with North Korea will be forced upon South Korea, as a leftwing government takes the power, which will aggravate the relations with the United States. What will result is South Korea giving substantial funds to North Korea, and even territorial dispute with the Northern Limits Line could result in South Korea giving up the waters to North Korea. - North Korea becomes more resistant and hardline, as long as they are fed South Korean money, and they become more militant, with increased frequency of blackmailing of South Korea. A series of clashes at sea and on land, finally escalates into an international standoff with ultimatums, similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis.

So how do we know this was a natural earthquake and not a retaliatory nuclear test? The timing, after all, is pretty short. By the way, how often do natural earthquakes happen in the Korea region?

Title: How does North Korea manage to develop/deploy ANY technology?
Content: How does North Korea manage to develop deploy ANY technology? According to the CIA Fact Book, North Korea GDP per capital is 1,800, putting it in the same range as Haiti, Rwanda, Burkina Faso, etc. GDP growth is just 1 per year, capital stock is totally depleted, sanctions prevent much global trade and technology transfer, 37 of labor force works in agriculture, unemployment is 25 , annual government budget is only 3.2 billion, annual exports are less than El Salvador or Cuba, etc. etc. etc. Okay, so given all of this, how does North Korea manage to develop missile technology, nuclear weapons, deploy a cell phone network? I guess the cell phone network could be a politically motivated Chinese investment, and the missile and nuclear tech could benefit from North Koreans who attend Chinese and Russian universities... But still ... when your economy ranks alongside El Salvador and Burkina Faso, how does any of this really get paid for? How does North Korea develop or obtain the expertise?

Content: How likely is South Korea to invade attack Pyongyang? Just curious because a military leader in SK implied that they will reduce Pyongyang to ash. Is this something that they say frequently in SK? Im pretty sure that China has a better relationship with Seoul than Pyongyang these days, but can't imagine China letting them do that.

Title: Historical and political context to human rigths violations in the DPRK [by the UN]
Content: Historical and political context to human rigths violations in the DPRK by the UN The following several comments will contain a repost of section 3 in the 2013 report of the detailed findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK The chapter, spanning pages 19-45 in the report, contains a very interesting and well-written political and societal history of the DPRK. Footnotes are not included here, but are available in the report. 1. Introduction and pre-colonial history this post 2. Japanese colonial occupation 1910 to 1945 3. Division of the peninsula, the Korean War and its legacy, part 1 4. Division of the peninsula, the Korean War and its legacy, part 2 5. Imposition of the Supreme Leader suryong system, part 1 6. Imposition of the Supreme Leader suryong system, part 2 7. Consolidation of power under the Kim dynasty, part 1 8. Consolidation of power under the Kim dynasty, part 2 9. Consolidation of power under the Kim dynasty, part 3 10. External dynamics and the human rights situation Everything below this line is direct quotation. --- The current human rights situation in the DPRK has been shaped by the historical experiences of the Korean people. Confucian social structures and the oppression suffered during the Japanese colonial occupation have informed the political structures and attitudes prevailing in the DPRK today. The imposed division of the Korean peninsula, the massive destruction that occurred during the Korean War and the impact of the Cold War have engendered an isolationist mind-set and a deep aversion to outside powers. The particular nature and the overall scale of human rights violations in the DPRK can be better understood through an appreciation of the development of the system of government in the DPRK. The DPRK is a single-party state dominated by a family dynasty which controls the party, the state and the military. Rigid ideological tenets loosely based on socialist Marxist-Leninist theory and an extensive security apparatus sustain this regime. Any description of history and political structures inevitably reflects the sources and viewpoints of those who record it. The Commission endeavoured at different stages to engage with the DPRK in order to receive directly its perspective, including on historical events. In the absence of any such engagement, the Commission has nonetheless sought to effect a balanced approach and to use the most reliable sources at its disposal to inform its understanding of the historical and political context to the human rights violations in the DPRK. Pre-colonial history The DPRK is often referred to as the Hermit Kingdom suggesting that the insularity of the North has been characteristic since its beginnings. The largely self-imposed relative isolation of the DPRK today is not, however, an extension of the earlier experiences of pre-modern Korea. It is believed that humans inhabited the Korean peninsula since Neolithic times, with the eventual emergence of settled communities based on agricultural production that led to enough surplus for horses, weapons and armies to sustain centuries of legends of epic battles among various indigenous kingdoms and against outside forces from modern-day China, Japan and Mongolia. Over the course of pre-modern history, Korea established a class-based system whereby a small aristocratic elite, combining elements of a landed gentry and scholar-officials, eventually to be known as the yangban, ruled over peasants and lower classes that included merchants and labourers. Slavery and indentured servitude were also practised. This class-based system is sometimes characterized as feudal and perhaps more accurately as agrarian-bureaucratic. In theory, this system conferred elite status on men who had passed a rigorous civil service exam and were awarded high-level bureaucratic positions, somewhat analogous to the mandarin system in China. Over time, the yangban became, in practice, a hereditary institution through the family registry system that passed on elite status through the generations, with its self-perpetuating privileges including the right to participate in local councils. The yangban class system speaks to the deep-rooted Confucian underpinnings of Korean society. Confucianism is essentially an ethical and philosophical system that regards adherence to strict hierarchies as important to social harmony and personal fulfilment. Five key relationships set out these hierarchies sovereign and subject, husband and wife, parent and child, elder brother and younger brother, and friend and friend. The most important of those is the parent and child relationship. In fact, respect for elders and social hierarchy based on age remain key features of Korean culture both in the North and South today. Likewise, the position of women remains adversely affected by traditional attitudes of inequality. Next Japanese colonial occupation 1910 to 1945

Korea? Do you think it could work? Do you think N. Korea is too strong to be taken out like that? Do you think regional allies will accompany US? Will the out come be good or bad?

Title: Is it just me? or the consequences of the Korean war are not well documented?
Content: Is it just me? or the consequences of the Korean war are not well documented? Hi, I am doing a semester long research on the aftermath of the Korean war, but for some reason finding quality sources on specific queries like environmental side effects of the Korean war is oddly challenging. For some reason it seems like the material is just not there. There was little follow up with war Veterans? Why is it that the use of children as soldiers is so controversial and borderline unproved? Sorry if this is upsetting for someone I am just trying to learn as much as I can. I should add, I am not researching political consequences as those are clearly abundant and well documented. I am focusing on the people and how they suffered because of the war, and what was the context of both nations post war.

Hey, I am trying to do a video series that I hope to start posting on youtube soon about the history of North Korea and bring awareness and background to the current situation that is North Korea now. But I am have a little trouble finding some propaganda films that I want to use to talk about their brainwashing in the country but I can't really seem to find any. Does anyone know where I can find some, or know of where I can possibly get some clips from. I don't want to buy the films because I don't want to support the regime, but if you have any suggestions I would appreciate it.

Title: Growing calls within South Korea for a preemptive attack on North Korea
Content: Growing calls within South Korea for a preemptive attack on North Korea I think a combination of surgical air strikes, rapid response commandos parachuting down to secure North Korean nuclear facilities, and a limited tactical nuclear strike on Pyeongyang could defeat North Korea's ability to order a counter strike. The entire goal is to cut off the head Kim Jong Un before it orders a counter strike against South Korea because North Koreans can only look up to Kim for all orders. Once the communication is cut off between Kim and his troops, the war is over. Wall Street Journal has this story today By DONALD KIRK Oct. 25, 2016 1 02 p.m. ET After years of hesitation, South Korean defense officials and members of President Park Geun-hye s ruling Saenuri Party are openly discussing the possibility of pre-emptive strikes on North Korean missile and nuclear facilities. Increasingly, political figures are urging both their own government and the U.S. to go beyond the level of study promised by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and enshrine the right to respond to North Korean threats at least with the heaviest conventional weapons in their arsenal as a formal tenet of U.S. and Korean policy. Nor is strike first the only demand gaining common currency among conservative Koreans. While North Korea s leader, Kim Jong Un, orders missile and nuclear tests, voices are rising within the Saenuri for South Korea to develop its own nuclear deterrent. The U.S. has opposed proliferation ever since physicists at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute were discovered looking into it during the presidency of Ms. Park s father, Park Chung-hee. Right-leaning figures are restive about constraints imposed by a longtime ally they fear might not rush to defend the South as it did after North Korean forces invaded the South in 1950. Korean scientists under a deal reached last year with the U.S. are on a course to being able to reprocess uranium for nuclear energy and hope eventually to engage in pyro-processing. That would enable them to reprocess spent fuel at considerably higher temperatures than needed simply for nuclear reactors. Although far below the level needed to produce weapons-grade material, critics believe pyro-processing would be a prelude to South Korea eventually building its own warheads. Political pressure for South Korea to do just that has spiked as Donald Trump has said that South Korea, along with Japan, Germany and Saudi Arabia, should pay a much larger portion of the cost of their own defenses. Mr. Trump s view that perhaps Japan and South Korea should have nuclear weapons has done little to assuage concerns among Korean conservatives. Assuming that Hillary Clinton is the winner on Nov. 8, they ask whether she would order military retaliation if Kim Jong Un made good on threats to annihilate Seoul or attack the U.S. As the rhetoric level rises, the question is whether they can count on the next U.S. president to defend them despite ritualistic pledges of dedication to the U.S.-Korea alliance. Against that background, a forum of Saenuri members of the National Assembly called for the U.S. and South Korea to come up with detailed and effective deterrent measures including a decision to attack North Korea with nuclear weapons if it makes another nuclear weapons-related provocation. And that s not all. The government, with the avid support of Saenuri leaders, has plans to develop a nuclear submarine a project seen as vital to deterring the North Korean submarine threat. Korean defense officials will need U.S. backing for such a project, but they re optimistic that the U.S. will relent even if approval of a nuclear-weapons program appears unlikely. Calls for a South Korean nuclear submarine are rising in tandem with North Korean missile testing. The North has a large submarine fleet and has spread alarm by testing a ballistic missile fired from one of its subs. One South Korean assembly member, Won Yoo-chul, derided longtime U.S. guarantees of a nuclear umbrella since the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from the South 25 years ago. We cannot borrow an umbrella from a neighbor every time it rains, he warned. We need to have a raincoat and wear it ourselves. The North Koreans for their part vow to strike first against a nuclear-armed U.S. We will not step back, said Lee Yong Pil, an official at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, as long as the U.S. has nuclear weapons off our coast, targeting our country, our capital and our Dear Leader, Kim Jong Un. U.S. and South Korean officials are talking openly about decapitation of the North Korean leadership in a quick strike at Pyongyang. If the word seems hyperbolic to Americans, North and South Koreans alike take it seriously. North Korea has said the term clearly shows why the North has to have a nuclear program for self-defense while many South Korean officials see decapitation as the ultimate solution with or without nuclear weapons. Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation was the name the Koreans gave a massive exercise this month in the Yellow Sea in which the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan led a joint U.S.-South Korean strike force. Their mission was more sharply defined than in previous war games. This time, said a Korean defense official, ships and planes focused specifically on imaginary North Korean nuclear and missile facilities, command headquarters and Kim Jong Un. Rear Adm. Kim Jung-soo, commander of the South Korean flotilla operating with the Ronald Reagan, reflected a widespread view about the need to go beyond war games. We will be ready to respond to any type of provocation from North Korea, he said ominously, and to punish when necessary. South Korean defense officials and conservative politicians increasingly believe there will be no choice but to strike first before the North fabricates more warheads.

This question has been on my mind for some time now, and I am personally trying to address this question and am looking for help. Personally, I can t see military action being taken in the near future, though I am not an expert on this topic. I know that action is already taking place in the form of UN trade sanctions as well as the contingency plans in the case of a war taking place, as shown by the South Korea and U.S. military exercises. However, I am wondering of the repercussions of an actual military attack as opposed to preparations and non-violent punishments.

Content: Two white guys who turned North Korea into a joke and profited from them Two white guys who returned to Australia after turning North Korea into a joke, are about to find out that this is no joke. I would not feel any sympathy nor be surprised, if someday North Korean agents find them and kill them, as North Korea is known to do. Reminds me of the other guy from the US who thought stealing a picture of Kim Jong Il was funny, and got sentenced by North Korea to life of hard labor. Again, no sympathy from me. I hope he enjoys his stay in North Korean prison. I'm pretty sure it's no longer funny for him.

Title: Planning to travel to South Korea around Lunar New Year's Time. Where should I go?
Content: Planning to travel to South Korea around Lunar New Year's Time. Where should I go? I'm really interested in Korea's culture. I plan to travel there with a friend. One of the most iconic cities is the capital, Seoul, but I want to know if there are other places I should check out, as a tourist, and what I should do in preparation for my trip. Any proper phrases I should learn? PC Bang prices? Any things I shouldn't do? Hotels I can stay at? Any festivities to see during the Lunar New year?

Title: egg and nut allergy in South Korea
Content: egg and nut allergy in South Korea Hi! I'll be going to South Korea next month for 3 weeks and I was wondering how hard it would be eating out having an egg and nut allergy. My egg allergy is mild, the only symptoms I really get when I eat eggs is feeling sick stomach ache . However, my nut allergy is pretty severe i.e anaphylactic to peanuts especially. I like to just rule out all nuts . I'll also mention that yes, I can have sesame and soy products. Now, I've researched online and found out that nuts aren't as common in korean foods - but I should steer clear of fried foods, hotteok and particular side dishes. As for eggs, I understand that I should stay away from cakes, bakeries, desserts and fried food. I also know that some Korean dishes have an egg placed on top - would it be easy to just say no egg? Also, is egg noodles a thing in Korea as it is in other Asian countries? I would also like to add that I do know that allergies aren't as common in Asia as it is here in Australia. I've been to Singapore and Hong Kong before with family members and survived just fine no trips to the hospital , but i mainly ate rice and noodle dishes. As previously said before, I do understand that food allergies are not common and may not be fully understood that I could possibly die if I eat nuts. But I don't want to let my food allergies get in the way of what I want to do in my life So i guess that question is What foods can you confidently say don't include eggs or nuts as an ingredient? ex. would Samgyeopsal, Soft Tofu Stew, Tteokbokki, Jjajangmyeon or other common Korean dishes have eggs or nuts in them? And what are some phrases I can say to tell them this? This program i'm attending has a buddy program so I assume I can ask him her to write it down? Sorry for the lengthy post, I am passionate about not dying in another country , i guess if all comes to worst though, I can just live off fast food, rice and fruit for 3 weeks haha Thank you!

Title: South Korea dumb laws?
Content: South Korea dumb laws? Hey everyone. When my friend from Korea was over here going to school with me he was talking about how questionable Park was. So he showed me a site of all the dumb laws listed in bullet points but I can't seem to find it right now. I remember the laws consisting of obviously a Internet control i.e. no porn b I.D.'s for internet so 18 year olds can't get on past 10pm . c Some sort of small gender segregation about roads or sidewalks for girls I forget and a bunch of other stuff. Anyone know? Edit d Male 2 year mandatory military service, which most start after high school graduation. Btw I don't think it's a dumb law but kind of just less liberal.

Title: Do you believe it's morally right to visit North Korea?
Content: Do you believe it's morally right to visit North Korea? Do you believe it's morally right to visit North Korea or not because you're giving them your money? I personally think it's not completely good or completely bad and is more of a grey area type thing because while you are giving the DPRK government money you are also condradicting their propaganda by being a friendly foreigner. I feel like we give money to evil governments or companies all the time anyway. For example, the Chinese government doesn't have the best human rights record to say the least and are one of the major reasons why North Korea still exists yet we give the Chinese government money all the time because basically everything is made in China. I think that North Korea is already so isolated and it would definitely not be a good thing if no foreingers went there. At the same time, I would not feel comfortable giving the North Korean government money and bowing to the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il while I was there and I would probably regret it a bit and feel a bit guilty for the rest of my life. People on this subreddit who have been there, how did you justify going there and do you regret it at all?

Title: North Korea is considered to be a top global risk by foreign policy experts going into 2017. Are the dangers being overblown?
Content: North Korea is considered to be a top global risk by foreign policy experts going into 2017. Are the dangers being overblown? I know North Korea has been talked to death around here, but as we head into 2017, I'm eager to know why it's considered a such top-tier global threat. According to the Council on Foreign Relations 2017 Preventive Priorities Survey North Korea ranked at the top of global flashpoints in 2017 along with a Russia-NATO confrontation and a terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland. We know from a variety of press accounts that North Korea was at the top of the list of threats on which President-elect Trump received briefings from President Obama himself. The CFR survey asked foreign policy experts to rank conflicts based on both their likelihood of occurring or escalating and their potential impact on US national interests. According to the survey the DPRK ranked in the top tier, with a potentially high impact and moderate likelihood of nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM weapons testing, a military provocation, or internal political instability. Are foreign policy experts merely saber rattling North Korea because Iran isn't as much of a nuclear threat as before and we need another boogeyman, or do they actually suspect North Korea will further escalate their provocations once they manage to get nuclear ballistic missiles? It seems like what the Kims have accomplished so far in regards to nuclear testing has been for regime survival and not for offensive strategy. By most recent accounts there seems to be a lot of activity in Pyongyang, and a lot of it being commercially related. Sanctions aren t working. China has been lax on enforcing them up until recently with the coal but, you know, the North has 50 years of experience in evading sanctions anyway so I don't think it really matters. And after SK President Park s impeachment, North Korea seems to have plenty to gain from a Minjoo party candidate, whose platform calls for greater engagement with the North, winning the presidency. So I'm really curious as to your thoughts as to why it is or why it shouldn't be such a critical global threat that's comparable to something like a NATO-Russia confrontation in 2017.

But anytime I think of living in South Korea or Taiwan I am constantly reminded by my peers that those countries are walking on thin ice. China is on a hair trigger with Taiwan. North Korea could nuke the South if Kim Jung Un has a bad day. So with recent events in mind Like the Trump Presidencies actions thus far what country is under a greater threat? Could either country cease to exist within the next 50 years? Which country is more likely to be pulled into conflict in the near term?

Title: The benefits of South Korea - China economic ties doesn't go one way to South Korea, it's both ways
Content: The benefits of South Korea - China economic ties doesn't go one way to South Korea, it's both ways Editorial Summary Even with Free Trade Agreement signed last year between the two countries, it is very difficult and very frustrating for South Korean business partners to make their Chinese partners to keep to their words. China's government, in revenge against THAAD, is keeping steady pressure on Chinese companies who are doing business with South Korea. Chinese media and people often like to point out that South Korea makes money off of China in the form of huge trade surpluses, and then end up giving the money to the US in the form of US military hardware purchases, thereby strengthening China's number one enemy America . But let's examine if it's really the case that only South Korea benefits from trade with China. - From 1992 to 2015, South Korea invested almost 700 Billion into China, which is more than eight times what China invested in South Korea. - Over 50,000 South Korean companies operating in China have created untold number of jobs for the Chinese. - While it's true that South Korea profits from China in the form of trade surpluses, China uses South Korean intermediate parts and materials goods to turn them into finished products to be re-exported abroad, which helps the Chinese economy. Both China and South Korea are profiting from this partner relationship. - It's the same thing in Tourism. For 18 years from 1992 to 2010, there were far more South Korean tourists to China, than the other way around. Last year, the number of South Koreans who visited China numbered 4.5 million 9 of the entire population of South Korea , which made South Koreans the number one foreign tourists to China last year. If China stops sending their tourists to S.Korea, South Koreans could also go elsewhere. - China is trying to put pressure on South Korea by putting pressure on South Korean economy, tourism, and cultural exports. But China is also hurting themselves if they can't even guarantee fair trade with a country like South Korea which has an FTA agreement. This will make all the other countries in the world that are looking towards China to increase trade, to think twice about doing business with China due to trust issues concerning the question if China can stick to the letter of agreement.

While I enjoy and think the food here is delicious, I can see myself down the line feeling a bit homesick. I'm from colombia and most of the food I grew up with is just that, South Korea is a diverse modern nation with food from all-over the world. Does anyone know where I might be able to find a Colombian restaurant, anywhere in the country? It doesn't only have to be the Seoul area, I'm willing to go ANYWHERE. If anyone knows I'd greatly appreciate it.

Title: Thae Yong-Ho(태영호) joins civilian life; Thae is into Korean dramas and pop culture; believes NK will collapse if Kim Jong-Un is eliminated
Content: Thae Yong-Ho 태영호 joins civilian life Thae is into Korean dramas and pop culture believes NK will collapse if Kim Jong-Un is eliminated Thae Yong-Ho 태영호 has now joined South Korea s civilian society. Thae was interrogated by South Korea s National Intelligence Service for three months, a customary procedure for anyone that defects from North Korea. Thae defected in August 2016 with his wife and two sons as well as his brother while serving as North Korea s deputy envoy in London. He is the highest ranking North Korean diplomat to defect directly to South Korea. Immediately, North Korea labeled him human scum and accused him of stealing government funds. Thae vehemently denies embezzling North Korean funds, saying he took pictures of necessary documents before defecting to prove his innocence. His reason for defection, Thae explained, was Kim Jong-Un s tyrannical reign of terror. He did not want his two sons to lead a life of slavery when they return to North Korea, as they were ordered to in August. While stationed in London, Thae was an avid fan of Korean dramas. Watching Korean dramas helped him learn about Western values and yearn for democratic ways of life. Thae also accompanied Kim Jong-Un s older brother, Kim Jong-Chul, to an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015. So this man knows a thing or two about pop culture. In fact, if you watch some of the speeches Thae gave to the followers of London s leftist and communist ideologies, you can see that he is very well spoken and is versed in the art of persuasion. His English is impeccable and he has clearly been trained in oratory and debating tactics to win over English-speaking converts. We can think of no other defector who is as accomplished when it comes to English mastery this skill set surely sets him apart and he will be prized by South Korea s intelligence community. More at

Content: Is Samsung Choi Soon-Sil's partner in crime? With Lee Kun-Hee on his deathbed, family made a bogus deal to ensure Lee Junior takes over. Bribery and corruption in South Korea How did Samsung get embroiled in the Choi Soon-Sil gate? Everyone knows Samsung. It is one of Korea s mega-companies often referred to as chaebols. But Samsung is more prominent and larger than any other chaebol. Its annual revenues account for 20 of South Korea s GDP and a quarter of total exports. South Korea, in fact, is often referred to as the Republic of Samsung. If Samsung were a country, it would be the 35th largest economy based on GDP. Well, it turns out, Samsung desperately needed something from the government. It was going to do the bidding of anyone who had access to power in the Park administration. For Samsung, Choi Soon-Sil may have been a happenstance, as it sought government intervention for an urgent internal matter. Choi may not have had to look far in finding a partner in crime ...

Title: Advice on job with travel to South Korea
Content: Advice on job with travel to South Korea Hello everyone. I graduated college this month and have done a lot of job interviews and have several job offers. One of the jobs that sounds the most exciting involves travel to several different countries, one of which is South Korea. A couple of my college friends are South Korean and they tell me that all the foreigners who work in South Korea are losers and weirdos who have drinking problems and perverted fetishes about Asian women and go to prostitutes very often. My South Korean friends majored in totally different majors from mine, so I know they're not trying to get me to pass up that job to open it up for them. They seem serious about what they told me. The job sounds exciting and it sounds like I could have a lot of cool and unique experiences. But I don't want everyone to think I'm a loser who drinks alcohol all the time and hires prostitutes. Are there any foreigners on here living in South Korea who can let me know if this is what people there think about you, and if it has caused any unnecessary harassment from the police or general population there?

Title: Former North Korean diplomat in UK, Thae Yong-Ho: North Korea will never give up nukes, KJU's goal is to become a fully recognized nuke nation in 2017
Content: Former North Korean diplomat in UK, Thae Yong-Ho North Korea will never give up nukes, KJU's goal is to become a fully recognized nuke nation in 2017 This is very bad news for the Opposition Party leader Moon Jae-In who is advocating to negotiate with North Korea on the nuke issue. Moon has said that he would break the Korean tradition of newly elected South Korean presidents visiting the US first before any other nations. Moon says he will visit North Korea first. However the defector diplomat in the news in this article said that North Korea has no intention of ever giving up their ambitions. Instead, Thae let it known, KJU's plan to stall the allied pressure on North Korea by forcing talk concessions from the allies, then dragging out the talks until it's too late for the US-SK to do anything. Pretty much we all knew this, but this should be another warning to the Sunshine Policy advocates that talking with North Korea is futile, and that only a regime change will turn North Korea around. Ignoring this warning is foolhardy. Thae also said that during the day, North Korean elites cheer on KJU, but when the night comes, they all pull their blankets over themselves while watching South Korean movies. Thae goes on to say that once KJU is removed from power, North Korea would collapse like deck of cards.

Trump has already destroyed diplomatic relations with several countries in under 2 weeks, especially Iran, Mexico, and Australia. So, given that, is Korea next? Moon Jae In is almost guaranteed to win the presidency now, and he's a Korean leftist which means he will spew some anti-US stuff. How will Trump react? As we've seen, probably like a toddler. So, then what? Is Mattis trusted and honest enough to stand up to Trump? So far, he looks like a good choice for Asia-US relations but after Moon wins this could turn ugly.

Title: [Question]If the chips fell and the US and DPRK exchanged nuclear fire, which (if any) countries would be obliged to join?
Content: Question If the chips fell and the US and DPRK exchanged nuclear fire, which if any countries would be obliged to join? I'm HARDLY an expert in this field, but I would assume that the immediate countries involved would be, besides USA and North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and possibly China. Again, I'm no expert, which is why I ask. I live in Australia, and down here, we'd be pretty secluded from the events, unless ordinance is deliberately targeted at us, and since we don't have any WMDs, it would be a very malicious move. But that being said, would we, specifically Aus but also other 'Allied' states be under any obligation to join? Forgive my lack of knowledge, my Google-fu is weak. It's just these recent events regarding the blank missile tests, the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, and now Rex Tillerson going around basically asking if everyone's ready, have got me a little worried.

Title: How serious of a threat is North Korea's nuclear capability to the security of the United States?
Content: How serious of a threat is North Korea's nuclear capability to the security of the United States? I recently came across the following opinion article in The Hill The article's thrust is that North Korea is 1. Capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead 2. Capable of creating an ICBM to deliver that warhead 3. Able to combine those capabilities to create an EMP shock that knocks out the national powergrid Furthermore the article cites the Congressional EMP commission's report that theorizes the ensuing chaos could kill 9 in 10 Americans . My initial reaction is that the conclusions seem wildly exaggerated, but the author of the editorial is chief of staff of said EMP commission and I certainly don't have detailed knowledge on this question. So, two questions 1. How accurate are the authors assessments of North Korea's nuclear capabilities? 2. How credible is the author's claims that an EMP would a knockout the entire US grid and b lead to mass casualties?

Title: If a new war is to break out, would Chinese and US/ROK forces meet "in the middle?" Would the Korean peninsula therefore be re-partitioned into 3 parts?
Content: If a new war is to break out, would Chinese and US ROK forces meet "in the middle?" Would the Korean peninsula therefore be re-partitioned into 3 parts? The Chinese would intervene southward, while the US ROK joint forces would intervene northward. They'd eventually link up somewhere. How would the link up be expected to happen? How cooperative would the Chinese and US ROK forces be to each other? And where would the meetup take place? I suppose the Daedong River would be the defacto border between the Chinese-occupied territory and the US ROK occupied territory. But of course, the Daedong River starts in the mountains NE of Pyeongyang, so how would the demarcation between them be decided on lands east of the Daedong River source? --- Then wouldn't the Korean peninsula remain split, this time partitioned into 3? Once the old KJU regime is thrown out of power and who knows what happens to KJU himself , the south zone would remain South Korea as we know it now. The Central zone, from the present-day DMZ to the Daedong River new DMZ? , would be under the administration of the US ROK joint command. The zone would be a new focal point of redevelopment, to upgrade their part of Old North Korea to the ROK's first world standards. And would the Central zone be given its own sovereignty as a new, proto-country? Would it be called the "Republic of Central Korea?" The capital would be either Gaeseong, Sariweon, or South Pyeongyang Pyeongyang-nam-shi? --- Then how would the Chinese forces rename their new occupation zone of the Northern half of Old North Korea? Would they allow free travel to and from their new zone? How restricted would travel be there? And how much redevelopment work would they commit to?

On this sub, and reddit overall, some threads have popped up asking why North Korea wants nukes or why they're so crazy or why they hate the US so much or something like that . I thought I'd give my two cents on this matter as well. While reading this, please keep in mind that I don't have any sympathy for North Korea and obviously have no desire for them to acquire nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles and also view much of their actions as destabilizing, but to get to the core of the matter we need to treat North Korea's actions and beliefs in a detached manner. -------------------------------- Much of the discussion have revolved around what can be done to prevent NK from getting nukes, short of military force. US exercises of deterrence and Chinese influence and sanctions are often cited along the lines of what may help to prevent NK from testing a nuke or a missile and keep fatty Kim from being too crazy, and eventually to get NK to abandon their nuclear ambitions overall one day, peacefully. Unfortunately, I believe such a prospect is unlikely, if we take a step back and consider why North Korea actually wants nukes. Is it because North Korea wants to have the ability to strike the US or Japan because Kim and his associates have brain washed themselves into hating them? Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover. And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle. But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security. First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway , but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be "next". Being listed on GWB's modern "axis of evil" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e. the US -- was by having nukes. What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions. The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive. From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival. For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. ----------------------------------- So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type . The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110 sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would ever be a threat to them. But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on. And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government. Anyway, these are my thoughts on the matter. A few of the details here or there might be challenged or debatable, but I believe the fundamental premise of NK's requirement for nukes survival sense of existential threat from the US , and the conclusion derived from that premise current US and China policy vectors being ineffective in both the short term and long term as being sound and stable.

Title: Has USA have nuclear bombs in South Korea?
Content: Has USA have nuclear bombs in South Korea? Hi, I'm trying to form the most possible objective opinion on the Korean problem. On 1953 USA signed an armistice with the North Korea, but then broke it "Paragraph 13 d of the Armistice Agreement mandated that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece replacement of equipment. In September 1956 the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford indicated that the U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the U.S. National Security Council and President Eisenhower. 33 However paragraph 13 d prevented the introduction of nuclear weapons and missiles. 34 The U.S. unilaterally abrogated paragraph 13 d , breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. 35 36 37 At a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on June 21, 1957, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the United Nations Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13 d of the armistice. 38 39 In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, 40 a year later adding nuclear armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union. 36 41 " from So my question is USA still have bombs in South Korea? I know that South Korea doesn't have any, but does USA still have them inside their borders, threatening North Korea? And second if the answer is positive, wouldn't be a wise choice to propose a peace treaty and the end of the nuclear program supervised by the UN with the promise of taking them away from there? Because if this is true, actually justify the North Korean nuclear program from my point of view.

Title: South Korea needs to negotiate with Trump, and change the outdated status of the US-ROK alliance
Content: South Korea needs to negotiate with Trump, and change the outdated status of the US-ROK alliance This is what I would do if I was Moon Jae-in 1. Sit down with Trump and negotiate the terms to eliminate the US opposition to South Korea's nuclear weapons restrictions. 2. Also negotiate to eliminate US restrictions on South Korea's right to research and development of cruise missile technology. 3. In return, as soon as South Korea develops their nuclear weapons, America withdraws its troops from South Korea. This is a win-win tradeoff for the two countries. South Korea saves money on spending on useless conventional weapons, and America saves 1 billion a year in the stationing of the USFK. Furthermore, South Korea gets new independence to control its own foreign policy, and the US can now wash their hands off of their South Korean headache. This is why Trump is good for Korea. He is turning everything up-side-down, forcing countries and peoples to get rid of the current status quo in North Korea. Trump may sound like a crazy crude madman, but one thing about him is that you can make deals with him which could be beneficial for both sides. What South Korea cannot do is depend on United States and expect that the US won't interfere with South Korean policies. And the US will demand more and more financially, that it will never end. There will be endless bickerings over who pays what. South Korea needs to stand up on its own and become a normal country with its own military controlled by its own nation. The US military leaving South Korea would be hard in the beginning, but it will also remove a whole load of headaches at the same time. For instance, North Korea cannot use the US military in Korea as an excuse to be so belligerent. China will also become far less patient with North Korea's belligerence. And there will be no reason for North Korea to threaten the US with nuclear annihilation. This will dial down the animosity in East Asia. World accepting and recognizing the nuclear status for both North and South Korea's, this region will become safer.

Content: question What happened in The Korean War that North Korea became such a miserable place to live and that they became so angry at the US in particular, to such extent that they still talk about The Korean War or general USA-hate all the time? I've read a lot about current day's North Korea, but I know next to nothing about The Korean War. I've heard that there was a particular focus on psychological warfare in The Korean War, might that have something do with the peculiar aspect of North Korean society where they try to control all the information?

Title: Another Korean War?
Content: Another Korean War? Long known as "The Forgotten War" in America, few remember the brutality of the Korean War. Made almost comical by the long run of the popular TV show M.A.S.H. whose theme song can still be recognized, the war cost the lives of nearly 3.5 million people and involved 22 countries to some extent. Now the possibility of another Korean War, potentially even more deadly than the first, looms over the world. The United States has repeatedly said in the past that it would defend an attack on Seoul as if were an attack on San Francisco, but now that promise may come to the test and many South Koreans are increasingly unnerved but what's been said..and not said. So my question is thus American's... It seems we never have much of a break for our military... Are you ready and willing to keep that promise made by our leaders? Will you defend our allies? The question is targeted to mainly Americans, but I would also love to hear from people of other nations as well, especially South Koreans. Please comment your thoughts. Figures based on Wikipedia...Don't like it? Fuck off.

Unless I'm mistaken, Putin published an article warning that the Korean peninsula is "balancing on the brink of a large-scale conflict" on 1st September, and the recent nuclear testing by North Korea happened on 3rd September. Was his announcement solely due to the impending BRICS summit, or does this indicate Putin knew about it beforehand? How much more does he know about NKs plans and should we give more weight to his warnings?

Title: I know this has been asked a ton, but what are the implications of North Korea and the U.S. actually getting into a nuclear exchange?
Content: I know this has been asked a ton, but what are the implications of North Korea and the U.S. actually getting into a nuclear exchange? I'm not here to talk about conspiracies or who would beat whom but I am curious about - International Perception. Does this lead to the United States being seen as a pariah in a way not seen since Germany after World War II? Historically, the U.S. killed 3 million or so Koreans the last time there was a conflict there. Not to mention other conflicts, wars, etc. throughout recent history. - International Relations Could this lead to WW III between the United States, China, and Russia? Obviously, there would be some sort of reaction to this occurring. Not just with Russia and China, but other countries as well? As mentioned above, this can't be a good thing for either North Korea or the United States after the exchange happened. What would the repercussions be? Would this be the beginning of the end for The United States afterwards if World War III didn't occur? North Korea would easily be in deep shit as well if it was still around. There's no way this would be ignored as nuclear action is inexcusable, right? - Environment What are the potential consequences when it comes to damage done to the environment on a per-country-basis and or global scale? Would it be limited to the area or could this have even larger and more devastating effects? What are the implications of that damage? How will the world react to the use of nuclear armaments?

Title: What would happen if the US simply welcomed North Korea to the table as a nuclear power?
Content: What would happen if the US simply welcomed North Korea to the table as a nuclear power? All of the discussion I have seen on North Korea's nuclear capabilities seems to focus on the fact that Kim cannot be disarmed by diplomacy, sanctions, nor military action. Even if China and Russia were 100 aligned with the US Japan South Korea ie, setting aside the diplomatic implications of any action taken by the US and Allies we still have the following issues 1. Kim's conventional threat against Seoul that makes any military action produce unacceptable civilian losses. The nuclear threat greatly compounds this, assuming sufficient intelligence does not exist to reliably knock that capability out prior to its use . 2. Kim has demonstrated an unwillingness to use his nuclear program as a bargaining chip. There is no indication that either sanctions or incentives will induce a voluntary disarmament. The one option I have not seen discussed is to simply stop trying to take the weapons away, and possibly to attempt some kind of appeasement. Admit defeat, basically, before someone gets nuked. We already have a sort of mutually assured destruction in place. Kim can't successfully invade the south, and he can't nuke anyone without being completely destroyed. It seems that pushing him to an act of desperation is the worst possible course of action. Also, now that Kim has nuclear tipped ICBM's, the damage has been done. The US has very little to lose from a technology transfer standpoint. This should actually make it easier to provide material aid to North Korea, since the potential for harm by military appropriation of any industrial equipment is less now. We could provide a massive aid package under the guise of "paying tribute" and let Kim take credit for providing the material wealth to his people. It would not be that expensive for the superpowers to make North Korea wealthy. Kim's regime seems uniquely resistant to revolution caused by deprivation, but it remains to be seen if it would be stable under conditions of prosperity. Prosperity would also remove the massive wealth disparity between North and South as a blocker to reunification leaving only Kim's desire rule...which is still a deal breaker, but a separate issue . What do you think? This is probably a crazy approach, but since I have never seen it seriously discussed I am curious what the consequences might be.

NK have been touting their all powerful nuclear program for years now, but it wasn't until the last several months that we've actually been able to prove their existence. The NK situation has always been difficult and it's always been delicate does the testing of a suspected H bomb and the testing of ICBMs really change the landscape all that much? We can be pretty confident that we'll see another test launch over the weekend. Do you think our response to it will be any different this time?

Title: [Discussion] Korean nationalists strongly oppose a war, but perhaps a military action is better for the people.
Content: Discussion Korean nationalists strongly oppose a war, but perhaps a military action is better for the people. This is my opinion based on what I have heard. It could be right or it could be wrong. I am not claiming everyone should agree on what I say I am just telling what I think. I do not think I am a Korean nationalist. Frankly, I do not really mind whether it exists or not. I am not completely on the left progressive, young people or on the right conservative, old people . For some issues, I agree with the left, for some, I agree with the right. Koreans have been educated to become nationalists. They were told that Koreans are one pure race, who are very smart and peaceful, who invented world's first printing system and whatnot, civilised the barbarous Japanese, and ruled the large land of Manchuria. They kept being told that the two Koreas must be united, because they are one race. So, as I assess, most young people are on the left and quite frankly nationalists. They are rather soft to North Korea. They say South Korea must aid the poor starving North Koreans as they are 'one race', and remain peaceful with the NK government by gratifying their requests. They condemn those 'righties' and the US who criticise North Korea. They think by having a nice relationship with NK, someday the two Koreas will be united peacefully without blood. But will it be so? I am very sceptical about peaceful unification. Now that the NK regime has powerful weapons, I find no reason why the king of North Korea would give up his privilege peacefully, unless he would be the new king of the united Korea. As I have said, I am not a nationalist, so I do not particularly prefer Korean people over people from other nations. I do not want a war on the Korean peninsula, because I have literally nothing to gain, and only things to lose. But if they are nationalists, shouldn't they risk a war to liberate NK despite the damage, to help those suffering 'one race'? I have just read an article about a defector. She described what she saw as a teenager pretty classmates were taken as sexual servants, people were blasted into pieces for the allegation of making pornography. And there are lots of other horrible stories. They may not be 100 true, but there should be no doubt that life in NK is not a happy one. I kind of now understand why those groups of defectors are so vociferous about destroying the NK regime. After all, they literally risked their lives to get out of there and their family and friends are still there, suffering. As I have said earlier, I think the possibility of Kim peacefully giving up his regime is very very low. And I do not think the quality of life of North Koreans would improve. Without a military action, the NK regime will never change, and North Koreans suffer and their descendants will keep suffering. They say if the US strikes the NK regime, NK would fire missiles to Seoul, and millions of people would die. But there are 25M North Koreans who are suffering and if we count their future generations, it could be over 100M in 100 years. If they are really Korean nationalists who want to help people in NK, couldn't they think that it might be worth to risk of millions of death which is uncertain to save tens of millions of North Koreans from suffering which is certain ? Again, I am not a nationalist, and I value my life more than the fate of a nation, so if I only care about myself, I do not want a war around me. But when I read stories about those poor people in NK, I sometimes feel that the NK regime should be destroyed to save them. What do you think? Am I wrong about the possibility of peaceful unification? Is there a scenario that without a war those people in NK become free and well-fed?

Title: What would be the ramifications of the US acknowledging North Korea's nuclear arsenal and normalizing relations?
Content: What would be the ramifications of the US acknowledging North Korea's nuclear arsenal and normalizing relations? Edit Sorry, I was on the road so didn't add my own POV earlier. It seems that nobody in the US has really proposed this option in public yet. I wonder if the US could pull off another Kissinger-esque diplomatic judo flip on North Korea, and over the next 2-3 decades, build up NK to be a stable actor in the region. In my opinion, NK is a rational actor, although opaque in their decision-making processes. Kim does not strike me as a foolhardy buffoon. His internal moves e.g., killing his uncle, assassinating his half-brother are cruel, for sure, but appear to be a strategic move to reduce Beijing's influence on his regime, not simply because he's a psychopath. My understanding is that NK is first and foremost concerned about the threat of regime change from both the US and China, and secondly concerned about building up their economy rejoining the international community. If the US were the first to reach out, could it somehow gain an advantage and slowly convert NK into an ally over the next few decades? In terms of NK interests, there certainly is no love lost between Beijing and the current regime. If the US could offer Kim safety guaranteed by a limited nuclear arsenal with guarantee of no future ICBM development an economic aid and development package, wouldn't he take it? In terms of US interests, this would seem like the US folding on NK and diminish our ability to pressure other actors, but if it is done by a new president that isn't Trump, it could potentially be a convenient way for the US to restart relations in the region and think about building NK into the current international regime a la China. Personally, I do not think Kim will give up his nukes for anything in the world. They are his only guarantee against a military invasion.

Title: The potential of a limited nuclear counterforce strike on North Korea using the B61-12 bomb
Content: The potential of a limited nuclear counterforce strike on North Korea using the B61-12 bomb A few weeks ago I read The New Era of Counterforce Technological Change and the Future of Nuclear Deterrence and found it incredibly informative and relevant especially with the situation that has unfolded in N.K. since. The B61-12 is a GPS guided nuclear gravity bomb that has variable yields ranging from 0.3kt to 50kt. It is assumed to have similar accuracy to the JDAM. There has been considerable debate over this weapon because of it's "usability". The combination of accuracy and a very low yield means that it can destroy hardened targets with negligible fallout and very little collateral damage. These weapons are set to be deployed in 2019 and I doubt it is beyond the capabilities of the U.S. to have a portion of them ready before. Even if it is unavailable until 2019, imagine how tempting the thought must be for the Pentagon to use the bomb in a limited counterforce strike for hardened targets with conventional weapons taking care of the rest. A situation where Kim Jung Un dials back his rhetoric and we return to the status quo is probably what most people are hoping for. I think that neither the U.S. or China want this situation. The U.S. will be seen as impotent, unable to even prevent N.K. from launching ballistic missiles directly over it's allies. It will send a message to the world that a modest nuclear arsenal is capable of deterring even the U.S. China will continue to be embarrassed by North Koreas provocations. More importantly, South Korea will remain willing to allow the U.S. to continue installing THAAD and potentially other defensive systems in the future. China has made it clear that if the U.S. strikes N.K. first it will interfere. They also made it clear that they will stay out in the opposite situation. As far as I'm aware they haven't publicly defined what they would consider a first strike by North Korea. It seems plausible that China might actually want the U.S. to goad N.K. into doing something that wouldn't provide casus belli for an invasion, but could be used to justify a limited strike on their missile and nuclear programs. There have been plenty of such incidents over the decades, and North Korea has never had a U.S. president use rhetoric like Trump has. If the U.S. succeeded, North Korea's missile and nuclear programs would be eliminated, the regime would remain in place preventing the refugee nightmare China is concerned with, and the U.S. will have demonstrated to nations considering starting up their own program that just posessing a small arsenal is no longer a deterrent. It seems like a win for everyone. Kim Jung Un wouldn't be happy, but if he really is a rational actor why would he escalate and risk massive retaliation and his certain death? I hope I haven't rambled too much, I haven't seen any discussion here about the possibility of a nuclear U.S. counterforce strike and I was just hoping to get some thoughts. One last thought - I have no idea what the implications would be worldwide once we re-open that box. One thing I've noticed that seems odd to me is the continuing reminders from U.S. officials like Mattis about how horrific a ground war would be. What is the purpose of these reminders? The narrative that we had to use nuclear weapons to avoid the casualties that would be caused fighting a fanatical populace that worships it's leader as a god sounds familiar...

Title: Your president says that North Korea fears South Korean military without the US alliance to back it up - do you agree?
Content: Your president says that North Korea fears South Korean military without the US alliance to back it up - do you agree? The Moon Jae-in administration is doing it again. His comments are once again undermining the alliance with the US by demanding the US to give up their wartime command and control. His logic is this. He says North Korea is deathly afraid of a more independent South Korean military without the US in the background. That's his logic. I just can't fathom this guy. I just can't. So why now? Why is he doing this now, precisely at a time when we need to show the North Koreans that our countries have unity? My theory is that Moon is extremely afraid of the US military taking unilateral military action on North Korea. Look at how South Korea stood still doing nothing while the US stealth war planes flew a bombing practice over North Korea. Moon's fears finally came true when the US did that without S.Korea's input. Washington now thoroughly distrusts the North Korea appeasing South Korean Moon government who has said that a war on the Korean peninsula cannot happen even if it means the alliance with the US is dissolved. By lessening the US military's role in South Korea, Moon is probably calculating that the war on the Korean peninsula will not happen. This government obviously blames the US for the North Korean nuclear crisis. His calculation is that a peace with North Korea can be obtained by unilaterally appeasing them by showering them with love. The US gets in the way of that plan. Moon's calculation is completely utterly wrong and it will fail South Korea's national security. He is playing a dangerous geopolitical game with our best ally and friend, which does not surprise me considering that he filled his high government positions with well-known extremely radical leftist anti-American protestor leaders, mostly active in the 1980's and 1990's. See the faces of these people now in the Moon government here. They are known as the Jeondaehyop which was a huge movement demanding the US forces to leave South Korea, and a peaceful reunification with North Korea. Moon was also part of this movement which advocated North Korea Juche self-reliance for South Korea with no foreign powers interfering with Korean people's self-governing rights. Once you know a little bit about Moon's political background, then you begin to understand what this guy is all about. Moon is a nationalist who believes in unified Korea for Koreans. He's a big secret fan of North Korea's Juche idea. He's an ideologist who overly idealizes the North Korean regime as a misunderstood lost brother who could be swayed into reason by showering him with love. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the goal if reunification of Korea's. But there is a problem if this means sharing power in the Korean peninsula with the current North Korean regime. They are incompatible with our way of life. But Moon thinks differently. This is why I consider Moon as the most dangerous man in South Korea. His miscalculations and his refusal to give up on his old ideology is leading South Korea to disaster. Ask yourselves this, once Moon takes full control of South Korean military's ability to carry out a war campaign, and with the US out of the way, do you honestly think that Moon will order his military to fight North Korea if North Korea attacks South Korea? I am now seriously doubting that. I expect he will order his men to stand down, while he tries to get on the phone to North Korea to beg for peace.

Title: Is this a plausible solution to DPRK crisis?
Content: Is this a plausible solution to DPRK crisis? Now that even PRC is disenchanted with the instability and insecurity which DPRK has come to cause in the whole region, what prevents PRC from co-operating with USA and its allies is the presence of US troops in ROK and Japan and PRC seems to fear encircling of China by American power alliance. If USA operates as a bystander withdrawing troops from ROK and Japan and either co-operate with China to install a neutral regime in DPRK or continue with the Kim-Jong-un regime ensuring that although he would not denuclearize but would stall developments and not utilize capability, I think the element of unpredictability is contributed by the presence of USA and China and in the opposite sides of the table. If his regime is going to be continued, if survival is what he is aiming at, his peaceful survival if granted is going to avert any disasters. On the other hand, if he threatens to show aggressive behaviour, if China and USA ointly come to protect ROK Japan, such crisis is going to end but if PRC is going to continue to support DPRK, any reaction by USA against DPRK, China is going to be perturbed. Rather, why not both countries co-operate? I know the probability for both countries to arrive at same page is immensely difficult but what if?

Content: Question Would the missile launch and response from South Korea be considered as the countries launching missiles "at each other"? My brother and I were having an argument about this. My argument was that they are not shooting at each other because the missiles only landed in the sea and did not go directly towards either country. My brother disagreed and said that both missile launches were meant to be seen by each other, therefore they were launching missiles "at each other". Then I responded by saying that the missiles that North Korea launched were not only meant to be seen by South Korea, but a number of other countries especially the US and Japan . He also said that it was not a missile test, and I argued that it was. What do you think? Who do you think is right?

Title: From Korean War to Sino-American War: Four Potential Scenarios
Content: From Korean War to Sino-American War Four Potential Scenarios War may return to the Korean Peninsula in 2018, threatening both regional security and economic growth. An escalation of intra-Korean hostilities could even escalate into Sino-American military conflict. Sound unlikely? It certainly did in 1950, when the US dismissed warnings that impoverished, backwards China would challenge a multinational coalition led by the world's dominant nuclear power. Here are four ways the Korean War could ultimately pit American soldiers against China's PLA 1. Conflicting Security Objectives In the early phases of the conflict, US and ROK Special Forces will rush to secure North Korea's nuclear infrastructure. Although the US has assured China that US forces will not remain above the 38th parallel, much of North Korea's nuclear infrastructure lies in the region bordering China. From Beijing's perspective, US forces will be too close for comfort, even temporarily. The PLA will be deployed to protect Chinese interests, tasked with establishing refugee safe havens, securing DPRK weapons, monitoring US activities, and discouraging the deployment of US assets near the border. With US ROK and PLA forces operating independently in the same conflict zone, the fog of war makes direct conflict a distinct possibility. Recent military coordination aims to reduce the risk, but could easily be undermined by mutual distrust. It's important to note that conflict does not require Chinese intervention in support of the North Korean regime, but could stem from China's own security interests colliding with those of the United States. 2. Collateral Damage In 1988, the US shot down a civilian passenger plane above the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 aboard. In 1999, the US bombed China's Embassy in Belgrade, killing three and injuring twenty. In 2016, the US bombed a hospital in Afghanistan, killing 42 people. The common thread is that these incidents were all accidents, attributed to human error and plain bad luck. If US forces in North Korea have similar accidents and Chinese blood is spilled as a result, how will Beijing react? For example, USN counterproliferation patrols might sink a Chinese fishing trawler, mistaking it for a North Korean smuggling ship. Or a cruise missile might stray off course. Or an airstrike could release radiation biohazards into China. Considering China's outrage over the Belgrade bombing many still insist it was intentional , there would be considerable public pressure for Beijing to 'punish' the US. At the very least, the PLA would be tasked with preventing a recurrence. This will contribute to an atmosphere of distrust and raise the potential for conflict between the two powers. 3. North Korean False Flag Attacks In the war's early days, North Korea could deliberately engineer conflict between the US and China. Imagine a cyberattack, appearing to originate from China, targeting USFK and PACOM communication networks. Hours later, US forces report multiple attacks by individuals wearing PLA special forces uniforms. Word would spread quickly on the ground, and US troops would assume their fears of Chinese intervention had come true. PLA forces in North Korea would immediately be viewed with suspicion, possibly even fired upon. The US would eventually realize North Korea's deception-- perhaps after capturing commandos in PLA uniform who don't speak Chinese-- but the damage would already be done. The reverse is also possible DPRK forces disguised as ROK troops or in captured US vehicles could fire upon PLA forces, sewing fear and division in the hopes of hindering the American advance. The fact that this violates the Geneva Convention is hardly likely to deter North Korea. 4. Exploiting America's Distraction Just as China prepared to invade Taiwan in 1950, the Korean War erupted. To halt communism's spread in Asia, America deployed the 7th Fleet to protect Taiwan, upending Beijing's invasion plan. In 2018, things are different China's anti-ship missiles keep US carriers at bay, and the power differential between China and Taiwan continues to grow. America maintains a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' over its willingness to defend Taiwan, but with security commitments in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Poland, and Ukraine, the herculean North Korea effort would stretch US forces thinner than ever. To Beijing, this may appear a window of opportunity in which America's distraction grants the PLA 'free reign' against Taiwan Beijing would laud Chinese unification as a parallel to Korean unification, to be celebrated as the end of WWII-era divisions. Yet despite the risk of overextension, the US could still spring to Taiwan's defense. After all, Taiwan enjoys considerable support across Congressional aisles and within the current Administration. Perhaps more importantly, a unified Korea and China leaves little justification for US forces in Korea and Japan. The removal of both conflicts would greatly weaken America's geopolitical position, while simultaneously enabling China to punch through the first island chain and project power into the western Pacific. Could US-DPRK conflict truly lead to war over Taiwan? They may sound like two entirely separate issues, but as history reminds us, it's all connected. Examining these scenarios alongside the many other risks associated with conflict in North Korea, it appears the dangers of war are considerably greater than the dangers of tolerating a nuclear-armed Pyongyang. Weighing these dangers also highlights the importance of close military diplomatic coordination between the US and China. And of course, by analyzing the ways in which US-PLA forces could potentially come into conflict, we can better understand how it might be prevented.

Content: What do experts estimate is the possibility of a US-North Korea conflict, and if one breaks out, that nuclear weapons will be used on the United States? I have the impression many anti-Trump advocates clamor for his removal by saying that he will cause us to face nuclear catastrophe, as his agitative rhetoric aimed at North Korea will result in war. However, as a firm believer in the overwhelming superiority of the US military in comparison to North Korea's, I find it hard to believe that aside from our troops stationed in South Korea, any harm would befall American civilians in the 50 states. Essentially, I doubt the North could fire a missile that could effectively hit the United States without it being disrupted and neutralized in some form first. Am I correct, or overly optimistic and there is a real danger? Or somewhere in the middle?

Content: Discussion How closely do events on the Korean Peninsula match up to those in the video game "Homefront"? In the video game Homefront, the Korean Peninsula is reunified under Kim Jong Un which later causes the Greater Korean Republic to begin expanding their influence and reach to almost the entire southeast Asian area. Meanwhile, America is suffering from a financial crisis which results in the eventual collapse of the U.S. dollar. Finally, America is hit with a EMP pulse from a Korean orbital weapons satellite, resulting in the destruction of the electrical grid. My question is, based on what we are seeing now in the news, how likely do you think what is happening now almost matches what took place in the game?

Title: What is the DPRK's goal with obtaining nukes? Do you really think they want to extort America and break up the alliance with the South, like the CIA recent assessment? Or is it for defensive purposes / regieme security?
Content: What is the DPRK's goal with obtaining nukes? Do you really think they want to extort America and break up the alliance with the South, like the CIA recent assessment? Or is it for defensive purposes regieme security? To sum up what I understand is the new CIA assessment of the DPRK's goals The DPRK wants the world to recognize them as a nuclear power. They want to threaten the US with nukes to eventually make them remove their military that is stationed in South Korea, and break up the US alliance with South Korea, not to mention the international coalition against them. Their goal might then shift to uniting the Korean Peninsula under their control somehow. I feel like the CIA's recent assessment of the DPRK's goals is the US justifying the risk they are taking pressuring the Kim regime. It also seems to be the US excuse for not engaging in talks and a reaction to the South's attempts at talks with the DPRK. It seems to be a new assessment new way of thinking about the DPRK's goals. It's like we are attributing goals to them that were not originally their goals, but logically I guess that could be their goal. It's a logical conclusion to a failed attempt at dialogue and containment, and the entire international coalition against the DPRK falling apart, and that seems to be a stretch of reality. I find it unrealistic that the international coalition against them and the fight against nuclear proliferation in general could fall apart. I find it much more realistic that the DPRK only wants nukes for defense and regime security. I don't think the US should abandon the idea of dialogue and containment. Too many diplomatic failures would have to happen for that to fail, and the risk of a conflict with the DPRK escalating is too much of a catastrophic failure to risk. The assessment also seems to make the assumption that the DPRK doesn't care about sanctions at all, that they will let their people starve and just look for illegal ways to support their military and weapons program. I think the DPRK cares about them, but they see no way out, and no one is showing them a way out. Trumps irrationally if miscalculated use of Twitter pressuring them on Twitter is causing that. Their people are starving... the sanctions are working. Yet the sanctions aren't being used correctly. It's not the choices they are making it's the choices they are left with.

Title: [Discussion] Why is reunification of the Korean peninsula necessary?
Content: Discussion Why is reunification of the Korean peninsula necessary? Nations and borders have come and gone throughout history and the world has always continued on. However, 73 years after the Korean peninsula was divided into two, countries around the world are still calling for the reunification of Korea. I think most of us here would agree the North Korean government needs a change. They should give their citizens more freedoms and open their borders in order to join the world. In general, become a peaceful participant in the world. But why is the world still determined to see a reunification? What's wrong with the Korean peninsula consisting of two countries going forward? If North Korea changed their leadership from within and opened up to the world, say as China did, would people still seek reunification or would a peaceful non-nuclear North Korean be enough?

Title: "North Korea nuclear issue will be resolved in 2018" - review of the issue from China's perspective. By Jin Canrong
Content: "North Korea nuclear issue will be resolved in 2018" - review of the issue from China's perspective. By Jin Canrong The video is posted on youtube. Date of interview is late 2017 I think winter 2017 is most likely . It contains quite some content that is a good summary of China's perspective. I hope this helps some people understand one of the hottest geopolitical topic. Prof. Jin Canrong is an outspoken researcher of international relations in China. To me, this is one of his better interviews and is unlikely to be misunderstood. I am in no way trying to promote his opinion. Please only take his words as a reference, because he was addressing a domestic audience . The transcript is below Start of the interview In 2018 I feel the North Korea nuclear crisis has approached a turning point to the worse . The reason behind this is the quick advancement of NK's nuclear and missile technology. It has reached the red line defined by USA, which is, NK is not allowed to have nuclear ICBM with ranges that can reach the United States. In the past year referring to 2016 because the interview was done in 2017 NK has conducted 20 missile tests and two nuclear tests. From the data of those tests, NK's technology made vast leap forward. Some of the technology has exceeded the red line, some are getting close. For example, NK recently launched "Mars 15" which is capable of reach the US. Experts predicted its range has probably exceeded 12,000 km. That is enough to reach the US. On the other hand, some NK's technology are not mature enough, such as the minimization of nuclear warhead, and ICBM reentry. NK is still a few steps from a true integration of nuclear and missile technology. In this stage, NK is already one step on the red line. The consequences is US has no choice but make a genuine attempt to solve the issue . Previously, US government opinion is like this NK owns some very primitive nuclear weapons, and mid short range missiles. NK will pose as a threat to SK, Japan, even the north of Australia, including ASEAN countries. And of course NK is a threat to both Russia and China laugh . US might think the situation is pretty good. But once NK's nuclear threat can reach the US, US has a change of attitude. Previously in Pres. Obama era, US policy toward NK is called strategic tolerance . Pres. Trump changed it to "extreme pressure". With the NK's technology advancements, and US change of attitude, combined, the NK nuclear issue has reached a turning point something major is going to happen . On NK's capability development Many parties should be held responsible for the development of NK's nuclear issue. Undeniably US must accept a fairly large part of the responsibility. Of course NK is most responsible. In the Cold War era, NK has made preparations of nuclear weapon technology. Today when we want to understand the issue in depth, look a bit further into history. What can history tell us? North Korea has quite a bit of industrial capability. Among small and mid countries, Nk's industrial capability is relatively strong. The first source of NK's industry was investments made by Japan . We know in 1910s Japan forced Korea to merge with Japan. They signed "Japan Korea Annexation Treaty". After that Japan made long term commitment to occupy Korea long term. They made large investments in building the industrial base. The investment focused in the northern areas of Korea. Why not the south? Because the southern areas do not have minerals. This is the historical context. During the Japan Occupation Period, Korea has developed some level of industrial base. Sometimes you see internet users from South Korea, blame China for the separation of North and South Koreas . This is not right. China was not responsible for the separation of Koreas , because it has nothing to do with China. In February of 1945, USA met with USSR in Yalta. They made a trade between them. USA invited USSR to send troops to the Far East, three months after the European war, to help US beat Japan together. As an exchange, Korea is divided into two. The South will be occupied by the US. The North will be left to USSR rule. This agreement leads to the separate occupation later. Then it becomes two Koreas. So the division of Korea is the result of a US USSR trade. More precisely, North Korea as a country was created by the USSR. It's government was created by the Red Army. In the hearts of North Korean people, USSR is the eternal "god father" . NK has never considered China as the big brother. Never before. Some Chinese people may consider China is the big brother of NK, they are very wrong. So USSR supported NK, during the Cold War era, USSR invested in industries in NK, and allowed NK goods to enter the market of USSR and East Europe. NK's industrial base is further strengthened. NK's first leader Kim Il-sung had a lot of ambition. His dream is to reunite all of Korea and becomes the national hero. So he started preparation for nuclear weapon quite early. In 1955 NK signed with USSR the agreement for cooperation in nuclear energy. NK has a lot of Uranium mines. They sell Uranium to USSR, in exchange, receive technical support of nuclear energy. The cooperation started in 1955 and lasted till 1987. With the pressure from USA, Gorbachev stopped the cooperation. By then, based on data from US, USSR helped NK to educate and train more than 2000 nuclear scientists, as well as 6000 nuclear tech workers. So NK has both some industrial base, and the technology on nuclear energy. After the Cold War is over, NK was in a difficult stage, national security, economy, as well as diplomacy. NK started development of nuclear weapons. We then have the NK nuclear crisis. On China's stance From the start, China and South Korea advised USA to hold a low stance, has direct talk with NK, and tried to establish diplomatic relationship, to normalize relationship. In exchange, NK will give up the nuclear weapon plan. But apparently, the efforts had failed. The main policy from the US is to apply pressure on NK, but not through dialog. After that we saw NK has been more decisive in having nuclear weapons. Then we reached a deadlock. In the process we actually had a few opportunities for compromises, but unfortunately none of them was successful. The situation had deteriorated to today's crisis, I think NK is most responsible. NK says the need for nuclear weapon is for national defense. This argument is not justified. In this world, many countries are under the threat of USA such as Venezuela, Cuba, ... to name a few. But these countries did not attempt to own nuclear weapons. If NK's way is successful, other countries will follow. If NK has nuclear weapons, SK also wants to have nuclear weapons. Then Japan. We all know Japan is supporting Taiwan's independence from China. Then Taiwan would like to develop nuclear weapons too. That's real chaotic. So even though NK's decision has some merits, from the global perspective, it is not the best choice. From China's perspective, NK's best choice is opening up, just like Vietnam. That is to pick a develop path like China. Once NK is opening up, we all develop economy, US will not come and attack you. We know that NK's public education is not bad. NK has a lot of resources. So follow China's footstep, NK is likely to be successful. NK has better options than developing nuclear weapons. But they chose, stubbornly, the very dangerous path. So NK is most responsible for NK nuclear crisis. On US involvement US is the second party responsible for NK nuclear crisis. US hold the advantages. If US makes a concession, especially in the early days, maybe the crisis will not develop into today's situation. We should say, the reason behind US's policy is very complex. NK's closing up itself, causing the sense of insecurity, and nobody will trust NK. Due to historical reasons, NK still believes his big brother is Russia. But Russia today does not have the capacity to deal with NK. China wants to help NK, and China is capable of doing so. But NK does not trust China. NK does not trust US either. China repeatedly tell NK to adopt the opening up policy like China did. NK always refuses. So NK has been stubborn, missed all the opportunities. On the America side, the problem is US does not trust NK. The r"report on national security" is calling NK as a rogue state, along with Iran, in the official document! China keeps saying all parties have responsibility. NK and US hold most responsibility. China and SK are most serious to solve the crisis. That is easy to understand. If the worst scenario becomes reality, it will cause great damage to China. And China and SK both have fast developing economy. We don't want to cause interruptions of economy due to NK nuclear crisis. On Russia's involvement The situation can get complex after Russia's active involvement. I think Russia wants to play a global chess game with US. Till today I still believe Russia's elites, especially Putin himself, are genuinely trying to build a good relation with the US. But because Putin knows, in the United States, many decision makers still have Cold War mentality. Those people have deep-rooted distrust of Russia. Because Russia and the US have conflicts, e.g. in Ukraine, and in the Middle East. Plus the Western media, as well as intellectuals, are not happy with the authoritarian rule in Russia. To add more pawns for Russia, Putin intervened in Syria, in the name of anti-terrorism. The result is Syria government did not fall, that is one of Russia's pawns. But it is not enough. Putin might be considering adding NK as another pawn. There is a possible development that Russia becomes the intermediary between US and NK , replacing some role of China. To NK, turning to Russia for help is risky. If Russia involves in this, the motivation is not to help NK, but to help Russia's chess game with US. Russia may sell out NK when the time is right. But you know, people can be stubborn at times. I suspect the elites in NK knows about the risk. But speaking from emotions, NK trusts Russia more. So we saw sometimes Russia is playing a more important role than China he was talking about some time in late 2017 On China's importance I don't think China should be worried about its status. In this crisis, China's importance exists objectively. NK relies on China. Almost all of NK's northern border is with China's. Russia NK share about 13km border. China NK share about 1400km border. Geographically China is close to NK. Economically NK relies on China. If in the worst case scenario, NK wants help from another country other than US, it is likely China is capable of helping NK more than Russia. This decides China's involvement is inevitable. In 2017 NK nuclear issue had fundamental changes. It went from an issue that can be further delayed, to a turning point into a crisis. It can no longer be postponed. We are approaching the final showdown . 2018 is a real challenge. I suspect the NK nuclear crisis will be resolved in 2018. The solution can be negotiation agreement, or conflicts involving military actions. No matter the format, we will see a definitive result. It is a huge diplomatic challenge for China. What do we know when war breaks out. China has its own interests, we can't rely on other nation's good will. We have to protect our own interests, that is the sign of a great nation. In a war scenario China should have its own plan. The views on NK nuclear issue inside US are split. Some, like President Trump, still does not trust NK, truly wants a war. But the mainstream US diplomats still want negotiation. By negotiation US is preparing to accept NK is a nuclear-capable nation. So far these two types of views in US have comparable influence. War negotiation probability is 50 50. Now the attitude of NK is important. If NK plays the game will extraordinary skills, US diplomacy may win. If NK plays the game too much, they will help the hawks in US. So the war negotiation decision is not only by US but also by NK. I think if NK carry out plans as their propaganda, that is, to have thermonuclear test in the Pacific, or NK shoots four missiles to Guam, then the situation will be very dangerous. US has to intercept the missiles. As NK said, interception means war. The risk of war will be high. If US, after sanctions, decided to blockade NK from the sea, to NK that also means war. So the risk to war is high. Here China must be clear, NK nuclear crisis can not be postponed further. We must have a plan once it reaches the turning point. War or diplomacy. the end

Discuss Foreign policy of North Korea has fluctuated wildly in the last year with increased missile testing to the current model of good faith and charm. Is Kim Jong-Un looking to open up the country in the hopes that past grievances are forgiven in return for future peace and a continued hold on power? Under this theory North Korean could turn into prospering or at least faster growing economy and the associated accolades of bringing peace to the region could cement Kim Jong-Un's place in the international world as a necessary evil OR poster boy for reform. On the other hand could this just be another stalemate to give time for their missile program?

Fuck Kim Jong Un, but its good to see cultural exchanges continuing even if it may not have any real meaningful difference in the end. I remember hearing about it was David Bowie and Hasselholf who helped bring cultural exchanges to the closed off society of East Germany and that helped people in the DDR see the outside world in a different way. The DPRK is more closed off and its a totalitarian dictatorship but still we are living in strange times. Anything could happen.

Title: Does North Korea actually push for nuclear deterrents against chinese intervention instead of USA/S.Korea?
Content: Does North Korea actually push for nuclear deterrents against chinese intervention instead of USA S.Korea? So I used to live in south korea and follow news about north korea. One theory I've had is that everything increasingly shifted after some point towards deterring intervention from China over the USA. Lately, we've seen North Korea 1. Kill the only potential heir a third party could support in the event of a coup. USA and South Korea wouldn't use that guy as a puppet ruler but china likely would. Killing of Kim Jong Nam's brother in public no less was pointless unless there was a significant risk justifying it. 2. Increasingly worsening relations between China and North Korea. 3. The temporary for now softening of relations between north and south since the olympics. 4. a new ruler who likely doesn't share the same mindset of his father who had to claw his way to the hereditary ascension. Kim Jong Il's nuclear program had it's reasons for existing but the current administration doesn't have to follow them. Said new regime might not be as secure against threats as the prior one leaving open new possibilities for China to influence or even co-opt the direction of policy. In the event of the new ruler considering unification on more reasonable terms, China would likely be against it. In fact, if the current regime suspected a potential coup by China aligned elites then unification with the south would become the surest method of survival for the elites in power. Right now, the potential of a first strike by USA South Korea without provocation by NK is extraordinarily unlikely as it has been for decades even before nuclear weapons . The only legitimate military threat risk right now is China which is the only player who would have a reasonable excuse to change the regime. Nuclear weapons serve as an effective deterrent against the last remaining threat and thus nuclear weapons R D has continued. In public North Korea says they are for USA, but in reality, it seems they are aimed at Beijing.

Title: Is Trump being played by Kim Jong-un?
Content: Is Trump being played by Kim Jong-un? The current administration is moving rapidly into talks with North Korea's Kim Jong-un without laying any preconditions Several analysts believe this is a mistake A look at the history and chronology of U.S-North Korea Nuclear diplomacy reveals a pattern of broken promises by the North Koreans. Since 1985 when it first acceded to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the North Korean regime seems to have cynically and systematically exploited the international community's desire for nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula to further its own survival by extracting concessions while yielding very little in return. The fact is, North Korea has a history of using negotiations to buy time for its weapons program and secure sanctions relief. Is there anything different about the current scenario and the plans for upcoming talks that leads one to believe that this time around will be any different?

Title: If the Korean war ends, what will happen to the US-ROK alliance?
Content: If the Korean war ends, what will happen to the US-ROK alliance? Some people fear or hope that the end of the Korean war will kill the US-South Korea alliance by negating its legality. But is it true? I mean, NATO in not at war nor is there a specific enemy to be targeted. In the same vein, the US-Japan alliance still lives on without specifying an enemy either. In my opinion, there is no reason whatsoever to stipulate on paper who should be the target of the US-ROK alliance. Actually, specifying your enemy is the most undiplomatic and stupid thing to do. Regardless of what happens between the Koreas, the peninsula itself is the most useful corridor for US forces should a contingency happen with China. It is the only land border where the US could deploy its land forces in a massive scale. There is no legal or strategic reason to pull back. I honestly do not know why people keep saying that the peace between the Koreas would bring an end to the alliance.

Content: Question How is the North Korean news agency reporting on the easing tension between US-NK and on the peninsula in general? Translated clips I've seen of North Korean news discussing the country's relationship with the US and South Korea tend to be fiercely militaristic, reporting on aggression from the other powers, and highlighting North Korea's military strength and capacity to respond. Missile tests carried out by North Korea this and last year were reported on with fervor and celebration. How is the North's apparent U -turn nuclear non -proliferation, thawing relations with the South and western powers in foreign and military policy being reported on? What is the tone of the reports? How does the content of North Korean news on the subject differ from what we in the west are saying?

None of it was propaganda or "staged" purely for tourists, it shows the ordinary and unordinary sides of life people going about their lives, whilst being mobilized for given state duties. Still, it challenges "conventional" depictions of the country and allows us to remember that North Korea is not just a regime, a bomb, a war or a man, but a people, whom despite unfavourable circumstances endeavor to get on with their lives. For those who say it is not a "true" impression of North Korean life, I will be posting another gallery of rural photos in poorer areas tomorrow. Enjoy.

Title: What was Trump's rationale for withdrawing from JCPOA just before meeting Kim-Jong Un?
Content: What was Trump's rationale for withdrawing from JCPOA just before meeting Kim-Jong Un? I've heard people say the move only undermined trust in America's word at precisely the worst possible moment. But given the timing, was it not more likely a deliberate signal to NK that they had better be prepared to make the concessions necessary to convince Congress? The worst possible outcome for the US would be a half-measure or incrementally implemented deal that relieves pressure on NK only for NK to renege and rebound in an even more powerful position in future. On the other hand, it would be difficult to demand to NK's faces, after their charm offensive and gestures of good faith, that they should give up everything before receiving anything. Could it be that withdrawing from the JCPOA was intended to resolve this dilemma? When negotiating with NK, the Trump administration can now point to the failure of JCPOA as justification for pursuing nothing less than a treaty with Congress, and then to the inflexibility of Congress as justification for making heavy demands before giving any concessions. The Trump administration can now credibly exhibit good faith and trust in NK's intentions by pointing to Congress as an unshakable reality constraint both parties have to work under -- a kind of good-cop bad-cop situation. Ultimately the JCPOA may have eliminated a middle-ground that was considered dangerous from the American perspective, but would have been difficult to avoid by persuasion positive negotiation. Any thoughts?

Title: My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un
Content: My take on Trumps meeting with Kim Jong Un 1. We are caught in a strange historical moment. Trump, the American President just shook hands happily with a North Korean Dictator. 2. US policy makers and president alike wouldn t be caught dead shaking hands with a North Korean Dictator. Although Clinton did meet with the Kim Jung Il Citation However President is Trump is an anomaly. He truly seems to act on his own, good or bad. So why was Trump able to set up this seemingly peaceful meeting, especially after all the little rocket man rhetoric? 3. North Korea is pretty isolated. Its main allies are China, who acts like a big brother, and Russia. Russia doesn t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly. They share a small border as well. 4. In the Trump era, America has entered a strange space. He doesn t follow normal American policy, which is obvious. 5. During the 2016 American presidential primaries the Republican Party changed an important party policy on the Crimea takeover by Russia. Trump apparently directed the change to more or less support the Russians on the Crimea annexation. Trump even recently repeated a talking point by Putin himself saying everyone there speaks Russian , therefore Crimea is essentially Russian territory. 6. Trump has flip flopped and given criticism to everyone in the past two years, even his own children. The one person he doesn t flip flop on? President Vladimir Putin. So what the hell is going on? 7.Earlier we mentioned North Koreas allies, which is important.. Who benefits from these Geopolitical decisions? Because it definitely isn t the US overall. 8. The United States has soft power all over the globe. Its one of the great benefits of the Post WWII order, which the US directed. America has 800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories 9. Directly after Trump met face to Face with Kim he decided to cut off War Games with South Korea in the Korean peninsula, citing costs. Trump seems to believe that saving money is more important than having a military presence in one of the nations most contested sea beds. Just south of the Korean peninsula, in the South China Sea the Chinese have an unprecedented presence. They have been creating entire islands in order to have more control over the vital commerce and shipping done by ship. After World War II the United states had near overt control of the oceans and shipping lanes something never accomplished by any other nation in history. So why would the United States jeopardize this accomplishment? 10. The winners here are many but not the United States. China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and North Korea all gain wins from Trumps meeting with Kim. Here is how 11. China, Russia and North Korea gain a win by seeing the presence of the American military vanish. In turn the Us military gets hit by losing a close vantage point where they can watch North Korea and China, while helping allies S. Korea and Japan. America has more warships than any nation combined even one of these vessels deters aggression in the region. This sea is also close to Russia, who would like to see American warships vanish. Trump thinks it s a waste of money and wants to pull them out. We ll see. 12. However the world becomes a winner if the negative warmongering rhetoric and threats go away. If Trump succeeds in getting North Korea to denuclearize it is a grand win for the World. 13. Lets tally up the geopolitical score here. Putin wins in a few ways. They see an ally of theirs N. Korea get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world. They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula. China also wins in these ways. North Korea now looks levelheaded and willing to bring themselves into the fold of the global order. South Korea wins because this opens the field to possible reunification. The capital of South Korea is 60 miles from the border with the north. South Koreans have lived under the threat of bombardment of artillery and even worse possible nuclear weapons. Japan also wins in this way. America wins if the North Korean threats are squashed for good, but only time will tell. It s a gamble but for a president who hasn t been able to court any domestic wins overtly, it does seem to be a win for him and his administration in a strange way, albeit a confusing one. Please correct me if Im wrong on any of my statements. Im just trying to encourage discussion.

Title: Prediction: End Outcome of Korean Peninsula Crisis of 2017-2019
Content: Prediction End Outcome of Korean Peninsula Crisis of 2017-2019 Prediction 1. NK will be a defacto nuclear power just as Pakistan, Israel, and India have been. 1. Trump will publically declare he is "satisfied" with NK's progress to "denuclearize" with an illusion of results e.g. site destruction, ceasing missile nuke test, ceasing enrichment missile construction, token UN inspections, commitment to draw down nuclear arsenal, draw down of NK troops along DMZ 2. US will give "security guarantees" in the form of a Peace treaty to formally replace the Korean war armistice 1. Trump publicly heralds the result as " truly historic and unprecedented ", bipartisan approval cementing his political legacy Trump Secures re-election in 2020 on basis of "Peace Treaty" 3. SK will see to it that NK's economy improves , to ensure that NK doesn't collapse and overrun SK with refugees with immediate unification. 1. SK is adamantly anti-war seeks to uplift NK economy to modernity before entering into 'soft-unification' via union or confederation in long term. 4. China and Russia will push for partial UN sanction relief for NK economy to keep NK econom afloat. 5. Japan continues military re-militarization due to private concerns of US defense commitments and strategic focus in East Asia. In the very very long term Trump has publically stated his intention to eventually withdraw US troops from Korean peninsula due to significant costs of stationing troops in Korea. Translation Peace with Honor There will be some marginal probability future conflict as the two Korea determine who will control the entire peninsula in 100-200 years.

Content: Possibility of North Korea shipping Nuclear Weapons and Ballistic Missiles to Countries such as Yemen, Syria and Iran? Yesterday Reuters reported, quoting UN confidential report that North Korea is continuing their nuclear missile program and that North Korea is cooperating militarily with Syria and has been trying to sell weapons to Yemen s Houthis.. Given the current sanctions on North Korea, what is their likelihood to trade nuclear weapons in exchange for undermining sanctions imposed on them, and getting economic benefits from countries which are not sanctioned or not as bad in a shape as North Korea. Such as Iran who has tons of oil to spare for example to North Korea. Can North Korea deliver ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons to other countries and allow them to posses nuclear weapons?

Title: US & China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was?
Content: US China talking trade, South Korea allegedly asks for an end to the Korean War, and the Department of Iranian Regime Change? - What's your take on the week that was? Here s our take on the week that was. We re acutely conscious that there are many smarter, and more experienced people who frequent this sub, so we re very keen to hear your takes. Our three most significant stories this week The US and China are now putting together a process aimed at resolving their trade dispute by November, when Xi and Trump will meet. South Korea allegedly asked the United States to consider formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War in a bid to break a stall in US-North Korea talks. The US restructured the State Department, creating a special group focused on Iran headed up by the former Director of Policy Planning a very senior role . Pompeo said this is about changing Iranian behaviour, while experts said this is about changing the Iranian regime. Our three most thought-provoking articles of the week Richard Haas, himself a former Director of Policy Planning, argued that without the glue of the Soviet threat, the US-Turkey relationship is destined to deteriorate. Rebecca Collard of Time Magazine gave a good overview of the stakes in Idlib, Syria a city awaiting its fate as Assad s tanks roll into position for a potential advance. David Fickling of Bloomberg asked big questions of the fundamental economics of many of China s Belt and Road projects, and argued that there are echoes of Soviet era collapse in Beijing s misdirected spending. Three events to watch in the coming week Whether the US and Turkey can patch over some of their many differences, after Turkey s Foreign Minister said, we are ready to talk about everything so long as there s no threatening, no dictating . Whether agreement on process can translate to agreement on sticky substantive issues at the US-China trade talks on 22 23 August. Whether US National Security Advisor John Bolton can make modest progress with Russia on arms control, at the follow up to the Trump-Putin summit. A a full set of links to the referenced stories is available on our site Hopefully that's enough to kick off a bit of discussion. - We're especially interested in hearing your predictions for the events in the coming week, and what to make of the "Iran Action Group"

Content: What are the factors that prevented China from democratizing like Taiwan and South Korea? What are the social factors and trends within mainland China that prevented it from democratizing like Taiwan and Korea did in the late 80s? If you look at Taiwan and SK's per capita GDP in the late 80s when they started to democratise it is at around the same level as China's per capita GDP now. So why did the political system in those countries liberalise while China's didn't? Even if not a full liberal democracy, what is preventing the Chinese political system from transitioning into a managed democracy like Singapore, Malaysia, or Russia, which are at least not one party states and have a real opposition which at least gets 30 percent of the vote even they if not full liberal democracies? Why hasn't China's economic liberalisation been accompanied by political liberalisation unlike the other Asian tiger economies?

Title: [serious] Koreas ways in nuclear energy
Content: serious Koreas ways in nuclear energy Greetings from Germany, first of I am not really interested in any clarifications by major news outlets or political parties. I would like estimates and general feelings from actual citizens. Thank you. I just have seen the Movie "Pandora" from 2016. At the end the movie mentioned that Korea is the country having the highest density of nuclear plants across the globe. I never really got into researching social thought process and view of countries way closer to Fukushima than Germany and Japan itself. Some documentary in Germany finds very clear words for the distasteful way Japanese government and energy business handled and handles the entire topic. I am very interested if someone could report for her himself how they felt having a plant blow up pretty close to them. Or if they know any reports or diaries of Korean origin written and published over that time until now. They can be unobjective, full of fear or risk denial, I would like the full board of available emotions. Thank you for taking your time to read this. Thank you even more when replying in what form ever. Have a nice evening.

Title: Global Security Implications for (Northern-lead) Union/Confederation Between North and South Korea
Content: Global Security Implications for Northern-lead Union Confederation Between North and South Korea SCMP recently published an excellent article about the recent drive by the South Korean government to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, and the broader inter-Korean conflict in general, by reunifying with North Korea into a One-Country Two-System Union or Confederation, which I have occasionally argued on here was the real crisis the nuclear drama was building toward all along. Why do I describe it as a "crisis"? Because there's very little reason to believe union confederation will resolve the conflict, pacify the Kim Regime, soften North Korea lead to its eventual absorption by the South or even lead to peaceful coexistence between the two states. On the contrary, union confederation could and probably would leave South Korea dangerously exposed to North Korean infiltration, political manipulation and coercion. There's a lot of evidence and analysis that suggests Kim will take every opportunity over the following several years after reunification to try and extract money resources from the South, wrest political powers away from it and bully it into becoming the lesser, subservient power possibly even with the goal of one day absorbing South Korea into the North. Indeed, North Korea has always seen Confederation as a possible means of "peacefully" conquering South Korea Personally, I think Kim might denuclearize, but only at the cost of outside powers butting out and letting it continue to cannibalize South Korea. I think this also could lead to a conventional war if, for example, South Korea resists or tries to pull out later, which may compel Kim to retaliate or attempt a hard fast-takeover in order to keep the South from slipping from his grasp, and if SK asks the US for help after . Still, even if that doesn't happen, I think Kim will go the Russia-route and resort to asymmetric hybrid warfare in order to bully or manipulate South Korea into compliance there's other ways to conquer a state besides outright military invasion. Even if "Korean War II" isn't a conventional military conflict which I've argued that it won't be , the global and regional security implications as well as the American national security implications are severe. Seriously, it's baffling why this isn't a bigger story and alarm bells aren't going off in the US public discourse It's difficult to list them in any specific order, so I guess I will just use the shotgun-approach lay them all out, since it's extraordinarily difficult to find any serious predictions on how this can all turn out. And once again, I'm going on the assumption that union confederation would be led and dominated by the North Koreans A If North Korea and South Korea reunify, would the ROK-US Alliance treaties and charters instantly become null-and-void as well as all of the international sanctions against North Korea ? Would a "Korean Union" or "Korean Federation" or "United States of Korea" constitute a successor-state that is not bound by the treaties of its former constituent-states? I don't think there's anyway to be allies with, or to sanction, "half of a state" against its other half. B Even if the US could be allies with Seoul after the deal is signed, it's difficult to see how political support for the alliance could be maintained for long. The ROK-US Alliance was established with the goal of compelling the US to defend South Korea from a hostile North Korea. Union Confederation might mean there won't be a "South Korea" for the US to defend nor a "North Korea to defend it from . C Would Americans determine there is no longer a point in sending US troops to Korea and pull them out? Would South Koreans determine there is no longer a point in keeping US troops in Korea and evict them? Or would China which has Okay -relations with South Korea bear down on South Korea and force them too kick US troops out and terminate the Alliance? Right now, China only maintains decent relations with South Korea despite hosting US troops because they understand the threat North Korea poses to the South it's difficult to see why they would continue tolerating US troops in South Korea once union confederation takes place. Korea scholar BR Myers has stated, "Imagine if the US military were in Korea purely as a counterweight to China...China would bring this whole peninsula to its knees in a matter of months." D If the US is stupid enough to maintain the ROK-US Alliance after North-South union confederation, what risks does that pose to the US? The US and ROK militaries are deeply integrated if North Korea were to merge with the South, how much access would that give them to US military strategy, tactics and intelligence by-proxy? E Joshua Stanton a former US Forces Korea officer who's testified on ROK-US Alliance issues to congress written for FP, the WSJ, etc. has said that it is no coincidence that North Korea developed its cyber-warfare capabilities at the same pace South Korea famously became the most wired society on earth. I think the implications are that North Korea doesn't want to nationalize or stamp out South Korea's market economy, but rather to profit off of it. And quite possibly, exploit it for its own transnational criminal operations drug manufacturing, arms smuggling, counterfeiting, cyber crime terrorism, etc. What are the chances union confederation will lead to, say, North Korean spy-ware on Samsung Galaxy phones? Or North Korean drugs weapons being smuggled through South Korean ports or maybe on Korean Air jets ? F If KJU fails to restrain himself let's be honest he will and the outside world continues to feel the need to isolate and sanction him, what are the chances that will negatively impact South Koreas too? If the two states confederate unionize, is there a risk that ordinary South Koreans might be turned away from traveling or doing business with other countries simply because they might be doing business with NK, might be NK spies themselves, etc ? G Almost two years ago Colin Marshall, of the LA Review of Books, wrote an article about the "Koreanization of American Politics," where he warned that people should look to South Korea to get a glimpse of where America is going in the future. Ever since then, much of what's happened in South Korea is frighteningly similar to Russia's hybrid war against the US and the EU hyper-polarization, fake-news foreign-propaganda, the erosion of their alliances, irregular and sometimes-illegal connections between heads of state and hostile foreign powers, etc. What message would successful domination of South Korea by North Korea through union confederation send to other countries around the world? Especially despotic regimes that want to "peacefully" subdue, or conquer, foreign enemies H If the US and the Kim Regime can't make peace, and yet the South does even if it means being dominated, or being used as a shield, by it , what are the chances of the US looking at South Korea and concluding "the friend of my enemy is also my enemy"? Just throwing these all out there because like I said, I think union confederation between North Korea and South Korea is a disaster in the making and potentially the major global-security crisis of the coming few years, and yet I can find barely any serious analysis anywhere. EDIT Sorry for the sloppy formatting. Bullets and indents appear clean and consistent on the mobile Reddit app on the web page though, the formatting is a mess. Hopefully lettered lists makes everything look smoother cleaner.

Title: All Hype and No Substance - the recent report from CSIS about "discovering" North Korea's missile bases
Content: All Hype and No Substance - the recent report from CSIS about "discovering" North Korea's missile bases As much as I personally dislike Trump and that I myself don't believe North Korea will fully denuclearize anytime soon it is currently doubtful, if ever , this recent article from the New York Time about the recent CSIS report is ALL HYPE AND NO REAL SUBSTANCE. x200B First, the obvious thing - the photos from the CSIS report dates back to March 2018 they literally say so on the images , before the first inter-Korean summit in 2018 even occurred. Most if not all of North Korea's token overtures about de-nuclearization occurred AFTER the Panmunjom Declaration April 27 2018 . For that matter, it was not until the SEPTEMBER 2018 Pyeongyang Joint Statement that Kim Jong Un even gave an official promise to explicitly not conduct nuclear or missile tests - Kim has kept his promise to Trump so far surprisingly . x200B Missile Base Photos from CSIS - March 29, 2018 1st summit between North South Korea in over a decade - April 27, 2018 . Trump - Kim Summit - June 12, 2018 . x200B Trump and Kim didn't even meet at the time that the photos for the missile bases were taken. In fact, North Korea and South Korea didn't even have their first summit for the Panmunjom Statement back then. x200B More importantly however, in both of the November 2018 CSIS reports that the New York Times refers to, the main specifics in the reports are almost completely based on supposition and lacks any recent data or sources - most of their source references date back to the 1990s, for god's sake. So why is a report largely based on references from 20 years ago being used to tie in with Trump's foreign policy, who's only been president since 2017? There was only 1 article from 2018, and that was the article " North Korean Missile Base Shows Operational Focus, from Jane's. Except this is stating the obvious - of course North Korea would maintain operational missile capability missiles are North Korea's only viable deterrence against the USA given America's past history of regime changes cough Gaddafi cough , and North Korea hasn't even promised to dismantle its ballistic missile program in any of the 2018 Joint Statements. Here are the links to the CSIS reports below - please, go take a look at their source reference footnotes and their dates x200B And finally, perhaps the most laughable thing about this is the fact that THE REGION OF SAKKANMOL WAS A KNOWN MISSILE SITE YEARS BEFORE THE CSIS REPORT. x200B In the past couple of decades, there have been multiple instances where missiles were fired from the region around Sakkanmol, enough so that back in no later than 2016 - over 2 years ago - there were NEWS ARTICLES pointing out Sakkanmol as a site for missile bases. The link for proof is below - it's in Korean though, so I'll translate the relevant paragraph. 이에 앞서 북한은 지난 3월10일에도 황해북도 황주군 삭간몰 일대에서 원산 동북방 방향 동해상으로 스커드 계열로 추정되는 단거리 탄도미사일 2발을 발사했으며, 당시에도 비행거리는 500 로 전해진 바 있다 Translation Prior to this, North Korea previously fired 2 short range ballistic missiles presumed to be Scud variants from the North Hwanghae Province, Hwangju County, Sakkanmol region to the East Sea in a northeast direction on March 10, and the flight distance is reported to be 500km then as well. And the date of this news article? July 19, 2016 . x200B But wait, there's more - here's a couple of photos from Google Earth on April 23, 2017 Does this look familiar? They were taken at the area presumed to be a missile base in Sakkanmol. You know, the one that CSIS discovered from March 29 2018 photos - except even Google beat them by a year . x200B The fact that one of the authors of the reports is Victor Cha should tell you something - Victor was the man behind G.W. Bush's foreign policy towards North Korea, i.e. he was the jackass who couldn't predict shit and basically twiddled his thumbs while allowing North Korea to go fully nuclear . Victor Cha is to North Korea what Donald Rumsfeld is to the Iraq War - during his tenure under the Bush administration, Victor had made no serious attempt to really militarily pressure North Korea having bombers fly over doesn't count since everyone before him did too , no real attempt to address North Korea's nuclear progress in spite of sanctions, etc. x200B There's a more detailed criticism about the recent hype about the report from CSIS, except it's a Korean article. If you have the time, I recommend reading the link below - I'd translate it, but this post itself is already getting too long. I personally think that this news media is at times bit more left wing that I like, but the arguments made are valid. x200B All this recent report does is basically regurgitate something that's already been known. For that matter, of course North Korea isn't going to dismantle its missile sites right now - North Korea never promised to dismantle its ballistic missile program in the Joint Statements, and it's the only thing North Korea has that can hit the USA. Personally, I'm more interested in South Korea's current attempts to lift US restrictions on solid liquid fuel for Korean rockets, which is extremely useful for ROK space programs....and possibly any potential ROK development of ICBMs.

Title: A geopolitical strategy for South Korea
Content: A geopolitical strategy for South Korea South Korea is the 11th largest economy of the world and has a fair level of autonomy in political and military affairs. It is the only country - among so many other former colonies liberated after WW2 - to have achieved first world status. We have a population of over 50 million and we have an evenly distributed economy encompassing heavy industry and IT start-ups. Now, our competition with North Korea, which haunted 2 generations before me I'm in my 30s , is over. We overwhelm North Korea in every dimension and there is absolutely no chance that South Korea would be invaded and conquered by North Korea. It is like comparing the power of US and Mexico. We know that, and they know that too. Hence, the nukes. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is the only credible threat or deterrent to South Korea and that is why they are reluctant to give them up. However, I do not consider North Korea as an existential threat. They are just a risk which must be managed accordingly, something like diabetes. You cannot get rid of it but you can manage it. On the other hand, the true existential threat to South Korea is China, its colossal neighbor. China's ambition is grander in scale and scope and their concern is domination, not survival which is the case of North Korea . It is no secret that they want to re-establish its dominant role in East Asia as in those days of the Qing dynasty or the Ming dynasty and we South Koreans are resolute in preventing that from happening. China's power is growing day by day and now it has become the undisputed rival of the United States. Never has the US faced a similar rival in its entire history. China's economy already dwarfs that of the USSR at its height and is now a very formidable power in most dimensions. Therefore, I view Trump's approach on China rather favorably. Yet, the US is not omnipotent so it must have focus and select priorities. In this light, I believe the US should reach a compromise with Russia. Even Stephen Kotkin seems to advocate such action. Russia is no longer a credible threat to US power. Its economy is but 1 15 of America's. It can barely assert its power beyond Ukraine. Central Asia which has traditionally been under Russia's influence, is being taken away by China. Stephen Kotkin has once remarked that Russia was almost a Chinese colony. He even went further by saying "should Russia crumble, Hungary would have a border with China." I am pretty much sure that Putin does not want to become a vassal of China and that he is proud of being Russian and its cultural heritage. So what does all this have to do with South Korea? First, China must be contained but its focus should be driven away from the Korean peninsula. Second, to that end, South Korea must reach a compromise with North Korea and bring it to the modern world. Third, South Korea must help Russia to develop economically as well as socially so that it can become another bulwark to contain China. South Korea is the only major economy which does not pose a geopolitical threat to Russia. We enjoy cordial relations and Russia is viewed favorably by many Koreans as well. Tourism to Vladivostok has skyrocketed during the last 3 years and Koreans are eager to invest in Russia. Many Russians are coming to South Korea for medical reasons too South Korea has one of the most efficient and professional medical sector in the world . Furthermore, if we could lay pipelines to import Russian gas, it will be a huge win-win for both countries. It would be a major benefit in geopolitical sense too, since it will serve as a restraining tool for North Korea's behavior. For example, North Korea may decide to cut off the pipeline at any moment but if they do that, they should expect Russia's wrath coming. And let's not forget that they have a land border with Russia. But in order to bring North Korea and Russia to our side, we need to convince the US to alleviate a number of sanctions imposed on both countries. None of them are a geopolitical threat to US primacy in world affairs. The only credible rival to US power is China. There is an old proverb in East Asia which goes as follows "遠交近攻" Make friends with those afar, and attack those near . It is a natural diplomatic instinct to ally a great power beyond our borders to counter balance another great power just right next door. Fear of China is what could align North Korea, Russia and South Korea to US leadership. South Korea is an ally of the US already but Russia and North Korea are not and they have their own exclusive interests. NK's is survival and Russia's is influence in Ukraine and central Asia. I believe those are negotiable interests. South Korea's geopolitical interests can only be achieved through an amicable network with several players. The KOR-US alliance is the body and a stronger and friendly relation with North Korea and Russia should become its right arm and left arm accordingly.

Title: Can an ICBM armed North Korea "win" a war against US and South Korea?
Content: Can an ICBM armed North Korea "win" a war against US and South Korea? How dangerous is an ICBM armed North Korea? The worse case scenario is if they use their short ranged and medium range missiles to rain hell on South Korea, and we have no way to respond strategically. They can effectively invade South Korea. Of course US troops can use employ tactical nuclear weapons to beat by NK's armies and score a military victory, however the destruction of NK's cities and deposal of the Kim regime will likely result in North Korea launching their ICBM to hit major US cities in retaliation. North Korea's missiles are mobile based so they are very hard to take out all of them in a first strike, unlike silo based missiles. The US could use missile defense systems like THAAD, AEGIS, along with the Ground Based Interceptor in Alaska and California to score a victory however they are not 100 percent reliable to prevent no cities from getting hit. Yes, the US military can probably win a military victory against North Korea, however I think tables will turn if China starts supporting the North Koreans. They can send their troops intermixed with NK's troops, making US fears of using tactical nuclear weapons on Chinese too much of a risk. US assets will have to be diverted to fighting China rather focus on the NK peninsula. US and China might agree to a ceasefire and NK will effectively rule the radioactive peninsula.

Title: The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula
Content: The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula The case for Russian engagement in the Korean peninsula Submission Statement Russia is today a "former" great power trying to restore its past glory. Yet, they are hindered by demographic, economic and political difficulties which are hard to overcome. They are aging fast, they are dying fast and they have enemies everywhere. Some western analysts are saying that China and Russia are getting closer than ever, and that it is a big threat which needs to be addressed. They are correct to a certain degree. But they need to realize that Russia is actually more afraid of China than Europe or the USA. They share a massive land-border and if Russia fails to modernize its economy, they will become essentially a vassal state to China. The recent Sino-Russian alignment is nothing but the result of immediate concerns and has no solid foundation. The real big player and threat is China. Therefore, I would like to argue that Russia must be lured to our side by providing her with tangible benefits, and Korea could play a key role in making that happen. First, it is necessary to note that the "Korean Question" is one of the most crucial flashpoints in East Asia. North Korea must be restrained but they won't unless they get something in return. However, last year has been a phase of great pacification by giving momentum to diplomacy and negotiations. Now, the US and North Korea are vying for some kind of compromise. In the process, South Korea has repeatedly advocated for a Russian engagement. We have made explicit our plans for railroads and pipelines. So, what does this mean? South Korea is the second largest importer of natural gas in the world. Russia needs to diversify its customer base. They are almost entirely relying on Western Europe and their relations are sour at best. South Korea can provide cash for oil gas and we can invest in Russia to build factories and create jobs. On the other hand, Korea can make its industry more competitive by lowering energy costs and therefore generating more wealth for the country. Should South Korea become richer and stronger, we could afford to pay more for US forces and we could buy more US weapons. South Korea can serve as a gateway for Russia for foreign markets too. Russia's Far East will have more jobs and more factories, more goods. We will bring them via railway to our markets and we can re-export them to the outer world. If Russia gets a regular continous and reliable source of income by establishing closer connection with South Korea, by having North Korea as a road, then Russia will have more than enough incentives to restrain North Korea's behavior. Russia has a land-border with North Korea, and Russia has the willpower to engage militarily if a third-rate power crosses in their path. A Russo-Korean South cooperation with the benediction of the US will serve as a good encircling web against China. It will enrich South Korea, it will enrich to a certain degree Russia and reduce their dependency of China, it will restrain North Korea by making them content to have a rent revenue. All the parties involved would be satisfied and reduce the risks of armed conflict. Therefore, I'd argue that South Korea needs a new Nordpolitik focusing on Russia, and that the US EU should seek a rapprochement with Russia to counterbalance the immense threat that China poses to the whole world.

I'm pretty excited but at the same time, North Korea could be pulling our leg like they did in the past. Though if we are tricked by Pyongyang again, the sanctions can be put back into place if the United States need to. Also I've read that there is report of change slowly but surely occurring in North Korea. Hopefully one day they will have their Berlin Wall moment. though that's complicated since the DDR is vastly different from the DPRK. Update Well, I guess I was wrong about this summit

Title: The case for a small-deal approach towards North Korea
Content: The case for a small-deal approach towards North Korea The last Hanoi summit ended in a debacle, with neither side gaining anything from the other. Nevertheless, contrary to expectations, the relationship between president Trump and chairman Kim remained cordial. Under normal circumstances, we would have expected fire and fury and threats of nuclear armaggedon all over again, but both decided to remain calm and leave at least some breathing space for more negotiations. Of course, Team Trump is still resolute on having a "BIG DEAL" and Team Kim is adamant about giving up all its nuclear arsenal. So the gap is still wide and it is hard to reach a settlement, for now. In order to break the stalemate and move foward, a small-deal, however small it may be, must be reached to begin a "process" which will finally deliver a functioning modus vivendi for the peninsula and the parties involved. The reason are as follows 1 The current stalemate cannot last forever, time will eventually run out and the US will not be able to respond. Kim Jong-un will feel compelled to renew his provocations if he feels humiliated or if he feels pressured to act and the US will feel compelled to retaliate if such thing were to happen. However, this time, the US will not have the support of key players in the region, such as China or Russia, and more importantly South Korea. Fire and fury threats worked once, but it cannot work twice. Back then, China and Russia were compliant to US demands, and the UN passed resolutions which put maximum pressure in place. But since it has become apparent that Team Trump is not the Mad-man it pretended to be, China and Russia will not be willing to cooperate with the US. Moreover, given the increasing tensions between the US China and US Russia, there is little reason for either country to do something in favor of the US. Actually, they are already violating the sanctions they themselves have agreed upon, and that is completely understandable from the view of Realpolitik. 2 A complete breakdown of negotiations between the US and NK is REALLY dangerous. The recent overtures from NK as well as the US for more cordiality and dialogue is unprecedented and has increased expectations to an astonishing degree. But when you fall from high, you get hit harder. In this case, the US will not be affected very much from negotiations being torn apart, but KJU will certainly be. His reputation within the regime will be hurt, and he will be encircled by hardliners. Even dictators or kings of a dynasty cannot act freely and they are prisoners of their own regime, having limited scope of action. The working logic of the regime demands that he has to show action should negotiations fail. That by itself is a danger for the Korean peninsula. Even if KJU may be reluctant to take offensive action, he has to do something to perserve his prestige and legitimacy within the regime, and that may incite a vicious cycle of tit for tat which may end in a catastrophe. 3 The US cannot handle tensions in all fronts at the same time. the US has alienated most of the world already, in a feat of bravado or sheer stupidity. US-China, US-EU, US-Russia, US-Iran, and the list goes on and on. It is time to make more friends and less enemies. However, the US is creating more enemies in an unprecedented pace, and the relative position of the US vis-a-vis the world is weaker than ever before. Today is not like the heydays of post-WW2 world, when the US controlled over 50 percent of the global GDP. The US cannot make the world in its image or control the outcome of every political incident in the world. The same holds true for the North Korean crisis, and the US should better accommodate a little in order to maintain stability in the region. 4 North Korea is not an existential threat to the US nor South Korea. North Korea's entire annual budget is less than a provincial city of South Korea. Its army, though impressive on paper, is but a decrepit corpse which relies on theft and pillage to survive, no better than the Red army during the early days of the Soviet revolution. They are more like a bandits and cossacks rather than a regular professional army. The only real capability which poses a threat to South Korea and its allies are its WMDs, and they know that they will be annihilated if they use them. But if they are put in an extreme position, that of a dead-end, they may attempt a suicide attack. Of course, such a scenario can be prevented if we give them an alternative and a breathing space, for their ultimate goal is survival as any other state. 5 A small deal, however small it may be, is conducive to peace and stability. North Korea may cheat and may retain a fraction of its nuclear capabiltiies, but it is better to have them under international inspections rather than no inspection at all And they have agreed to an international inspection . It is better to dismantle Yongbyeon than not closing them at all. A small deal, just small enough to save face for NK and the US will mark not an end of negotiations but the start of a process which will enable more regular contacts and that will create a modus vivendi for the parties involved. Step by step, NK will get what they want, and the US SK will get what they want, thus creating a cycle for mutually beneficial deals. 6 Strategically speaking, it is also in the American interest to engage productively with North Korea, because otherwise they will feel compelled to align completely with China and Russia , thus creating again the old cold war blocs. And this is already happening, just after the Hanoi debacle. North Korea must not become a Chinese or Russian lackey and they should remain a buffer, as they have always been, and preferably they should be under our influence, rather than Chinese or Russian.

It makes sense because South Korea has an already good alliance with USA, needs more better relationship with Japan, and have to make against Chinese power proliferation. However, this proposal could be considered more because it is hard to make genuine relationship with Japan, regarding historical anti-Japan sentiment in South Korea. Also, I heard that this trial make China, Russia and North Korea provoked to form more explicit NK-China-Russia alliance against SK-Japan-US alliance. What do you think of this triangular alliance proposal?

Title: Are these fishing boats? (dprk watching)
Content: Are these fishing boats? dprk watching I was going up the east coast of north korea, exploring on google maps, just kind of looking around, but when I got to Chongjin there were a couple places that really caught my eye. Here they are First place. Second place. The first place at least does not look ice bound, while the second does map info is apparently 2019, so probably winter . Apart from the ice at the second place, in neither place does it look like the boats could go anywhere soon--how long would it take to get those boats out of such a crammed up situation? It would have to take days. Wikipedia says that Chongjin was hit hard by the '90s famine, that it has some prisons and a re-education camp, and that shipping is important. Just SW of the second place, there appears to be a larger port, with only a few larger ships and some smaller one . Also, there appear to be some rail lines leading over there, so that is probably where the 'shipping' takes place. The first and second places, above, appear tome to be fishing boats, stored away for some reason. What do you think?

Title: Is Trump's dismissal of worry over North Korea's continued missile activities basically correct?
Content: Is Trump's dismissal of worry over North Korea's continued missile activities basically correct? Trump seems to be suggesting that the Koreans are simply posturing. Isn't that right, and don't we see this all the time? The U.S. has been posturing in the Middle East big time for weeks now to threaten Iran. The Russians recently flew planes near our northern borders--again, for about the umpteenth time. The Chinese will likely provoke some new issue in the South China sea soon, prompting more U.S. ship movements in the area, amid rhetoric. Posturing is what nations do, especially semi-belligerent nations at odds with other semi-belligerent nations. North Korea has nukes. It has missiles. What else is new? Kim Jong-un is posturing to try to influence the sanctions on him. Should we accept that for what it appears to be, or agree with John Bolton's more hardline views on North Korea.

Aside from KPop and the massive popularity of BTS, Kdramas are massively increasing in popularity, Korean beauty products, their films. And there there is Samsung and Hyundai. So many young teens want to learn Korean. It seems they are the most popular and liked Asian country in the west. Why are they so successful at soft power?

Content: Historically, which countries have agreed to denuclearize after acquiring the domestic ability to produce nuclear weapons? Is this a reasonable goal for US policy towards North Korea? With recent summits and meetings between North Korean leadership and the rest of the world, what is the chance that North Korea will unilaterally destroy their nuclear weapons? Based on my understanding of the North Korean view, they are looking for a mutual agreement denuclearize the Korean peninsula including South Korea , which seems like a non-starter for the USA. What kinds of concessions can realistically be expected from a nuclear armed state in this kind of situation?

Title: Why the US does not want North Korea and Iran to have nukes
Content: Why the US does not want North Korea and Iran to have nukes North Korea and Iran are on the news for their nuclear ambitions. Iran is on the way to having the capability and North Korea is on its way to have a working ICBM. It is cited they are they using it for deterence, to prevent their nation from collapse by an outside power. Critics of US policy has cited nuclear weapons are for defense against the US, and the US has nothing to worry about. However, the US has constantly provoked North Korea and the tensions got so high it almost amounted to war. Why is this? Why does the US fear third rate powers with nukes? The answer is it defeats the Flexible Response doctrine of the US. Typically US military is there to counter top powers like the Soviet Union. The US uses a system called "Flexible Response" to counter both nuclear and conventional threats. It also suscribes to "proportional respond" to defend its allies. If the enemy uses conventional forces, the reponse is conventional response back, if nukes the US will use nukes. Take US v China on Taiwan. If US does get in a war where China is using conventional weapons, US could win likely with its 10 carriers, thousands of fighters, nuclear submarines and better tech. If China were tip to scale using tactical nuclear weapons, US could respond by hitting non-city Chinese targets, with its more warheads. US has more missile defenses, more carriers that can hide and move, and intel assets, so even in a non-city nuclear war US could come out of top with both sides bloodied. A total strategic nuclear war, it would be Mutually Assured Destructuction, but I doubt China will give its cities for Taiwan. Now this is the doctrine against a power like China or Russia. But enter North Korea with an ICBM and everything changes. North Korea is just as capable of defeating US static targets like military bases in Asia with its medium range nuclear missile force. Without ICBMs with answer was easy, take out North Korea completly including city targets with nukes or overwhelming conventional superiority . However with an ICBM, North Korea could destroy US cities. With an ICBM, North Korea using its medium range missile destroying major US bases will cripple US capability on the Pacific and the US would be limited to restrained retaliation. US can't destroy Pyongyang and topple the regime without getting LA and New York getting nuked. It could nuke the North Korean military bases, but that won't topple the regime, just contain North Korea and beat back its military from taking the South. US military would still be bloodied after a Phyric victory, used a lot of its nukes on a rather insignifcant nation...and now China is possibly much stronger and could be possibly on parity with US capability. x200B This is why US doesn't want such a insignificant power to get nukes. It is very imbalance of power. So why would North Korea risk such a move? Well in the US mind, beligerents are not rational, and would take huge risks even with a high chance of losing. Japan, Germany, Saddam etc . North Korea may use its nukes to say "give up South Korea or your Pacific military will be crippled by nukes". Just like how Saddam planned to US surrender by fighting a bloody battle where the US civilian populace would give up it didn't happen thanks to US conventional superiority So what could the US do? Well the answer now is Missile Defense. The problem is that it is not a 100 percent defense, but it may be able to save major military bases against the Medium range threat, ie. THAAD while new interepotrs in Alaska can stop the ICBM threat. North Korea doesn't have a working ICBM yet, hopefully US tests would be make Missile Defense good enough in time. US would be putting Missile Defense in Europe to defend against Russia. However, Iran has no ICBM yet, so that is less of a threat.

Title: What do you think of Japan's recent export restrictions on South Korea?
Content: What do you think of Japan's recent export restrictions on South Korea? Japan recently tightened export restrictions to South Korea on three materials used to make semiconductors and smartphone displays eg. OLED displays , while also threatening to remove South Korea from a list of trusted buyers. This comes after a South Korean court last year ordered two Japanese conglomerates to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to Korean plaintiffs over forced labor claims during WWII, which Japan states is a violation of their 1965 treaty that was supposed to normalize all ties between Japan and Korea. South Korea in response has dissolved a compensation fund for the "comfort women", and there are talks of retaliation in the form of boycotts and such. Is Japan justified in doing this, and is this a good move on their part? --- I'll admit I have not been following this, so here's my elementary layman's take The 1965 treaty was supposed to normalize all ties and settle all issues of compensation between Japan and Korea Japan paid 300 million . Thus I do not see why South Korea is owed additional compensation for wartime crimes that happened 80 years ago. Japan has already apologized and paid reparations to Korea, why does Korea still think it's owed more? Wasn't this issue officially settled already by the treaty? At what point does this end? But all that being said, I do not see how starting a trade war is a good move on Japan's part. Korea will surely retaliate with its own trade restrictions against Japan, seek to purchase those materials elsewhere and develop their own way to source manufacture these materials, and Japan will likely be worse off in the long run. Korea isn't some insignificant developing country, they are the world's leading producer of memory chips with companies like Samsung, I don't see the benefit here in starting a trade war. I just don't see the rationale here for Japan. I'm just guessing here, but I'd wager that most Japanese citizens probably don't support these export restrictions, or honestly even care about Korea's constant apology reparation demands for war crimes that happened 80 years ago that were supposed to be settled in 1965. I think ignoring is the better way to go, not starting a trade war.

Title: (Perspective) South Korea's quest for a new role in the world.
Content: Perspective South Korea's quest for a new role in the world. South Korea, once a war-torn country, poorer than most African nations, is today one of the wealthiest nations in the world. Although there was a time when it was ruled by a military junta, after several years of struggle and protests, South Korea is today a thriving liberal democracy . Writings of the French enlightenment and American emancipation are widely taught at universities and books about world history Yuval Harari, Jared Diamond, Peter Frankopan, etc and geopolitics George Friedman, Peter Zeihan, etc are widely popular. Big companies like Samsung and Hyundai are national champions and all of the country, including the most remote areas, is fully covered with fast-speed WiFi. In short, South Korea is the most successful offspring of the post-WW2 settlement. However, South Korea is surrounded by the greatest powers in the world China, Russia, Japan and of course North Korea although nobody would call NK a great power . It is located in the worst possible geopolitical location and it must confront a very hard reality. China aims to recover its hegemony over East Asia, Japan aims to curtail South Korea's rise and has difficulties in acknowledging and expressing remorse over its past deeds, North Korea is always behaving as a spoiled kid and Russia is distant and far-away and cooperates with China in a number of cases . In such precarious a situation, South Korea's only reliable ally is the United States and this has served well for 70 years already. Now, despite Trump's aggressiveness and lunacy, South Korea enjoys a superb and privileged relationship with the US. That is because our interests are aligned. Trump wants to get diplomatic scores in NK and South Korea wants to normalize relations with NK to open up trade. Currently, South Korea is pursuing a very assertive economic diplomacy with a number of key partners. In February, there was a summit with UAE and we signed a number of agreements to develop infrastructure. In June, there was a summit with MBS of Saudi Arabia and we signed agreements to secure oil and further investment. This July, we had a summit with Israel and we agreed to deepen cooperation in the sector of A.I. In sum, South Korea has had high level meetings with the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel thereby reducing its dependence on Iranian oil or Iranian markets. Furthermore, South Korea is discussing with the US for a possible expedition to the strait of Hormuz and the likelihood of agreement is very high. Even Korean leftists who were considered to be anti-American largely agree that we must align ourselves with the US to counter not only China but Japan. So domestic opposition for a possible foreign expedition is negligible. On top of that, yesterday, South Korea opened fire to a Russian aircraft which violated Korean airspace Over the Dokdo Takeshima Island . It is the first time that South Korea opened fire to a foreign aircraft since the Korean War . In doing so, South Korea demonstrated its resolve to protect its sovereignty and also that it had real and effective jurisdiction over the disputed Island . It also showed to the world that it is a force which should be reckoned with. However, it has no significant issues with Russia, and it enjoys a very cordial relationship with Russia. Russia knows this, and they are also trying to de-escalate the incident and turning it into a non-issue. South Korea is also negotiating a possible trade deal with the UK in case it drops out of the EU , and it has proclaimed a Southern policy focused in fostering and improving ties with Southeast Asian nations. This policy is compatible with US led Indo-Pacific strategy and South Korea may also play part as a bridge between the US led order and the Chinese led Belt and Road. In order to do that, South Korea needs first a peaceful and cooperative relation with North Korea, open it up for investment and trade. Once that first step is completed, South Korea may be able to become a new geopolitical player which must be taken into account.

Title: Are there any differences in the way China and South Korea developed economically?
Content: Are there any differences in the way China and South Korea developed economically? I am writing a comparison essay for a course in college in regards to the similarities and difference of the historical economic development path of South Korea and China. I have a list of similarities, but I am having trouble coming up with differences, besides South Korea started earlier and is no longer ruled by an authoritarian leader. Here are the similarities 1. Both started from an impoverished agricultural economy with little to no industrial base 2. Both relied on cheap labor costs to attract foreign investment into manufacturing 3. Both copied and made gradual improvements on western products 4. Both relied on state-backed conglomerates or "Chaebols" to achieve efficiency of scale 5. Both still heavily relies on exports as the main driver of GDP growth and slaps huge tariffs on imports to protect domestic companies Here are the differences 1. SK had a head start and is further along the process than China 2. SK transitioned to democracy 3. ? Can someone help me identify some more differences?

Title: [Question] Movies set in DPRK?
Content: Question Movies set in DPRK? repost because subreddit's bot was mean to me for i didnt understand how those self-appointed discussion question flairs work Anyway, I was wondering whether there exists a western culture movie set in North Korea. Of course, not filmed there, since I doubt it would be possible, but set - its events taking place supposedly in DPRK, characters North Korean etc. This might be a weird question, I know, but I found literally every movie about North Koreans is a more or less documentary movie . And thats not what I'm looking for... Just out of curiosity, I would like me a nice movie, low-key reflecting upon the hardships of life there, while also having its drama focused plot independent of the rough reality. And I am not talking about North Korean movies though this would be quite interesting to watch too since they must be filled with propaganda, if they exist.

Title: Japan didn't have details about recent North Korea missile and asked South Korea for intel
Content: Japan didn't have details about recent North Korea missile and asked South Korea for intel I'm sure some people have noticed this particular thread link where it was said that Japan reported the missile firing earlier than South Korea. About 10-14 minutes depending on who you ask. And if you were to have read watched the Japanese news media reporting on this, many of them took time to write talk about this in detail, with many TV commentators remarking that this shows that Japan manage to get intel about North Korea just fine without South Korea. For example This Japan Times article That's not the case in reality. It's the opposite Japan had no tangible intel about the launch itself on its own and asked South Korea for assistance. As reported by KBS - link here - the article states that the South Korean Ministry of Defense noticed the missile launch before Japan, but took a little over 10 minutes to give the news was because it was analyzing the missile launch with the US military about the details speed, trajectory, altitude, etc. 발사 사실은 우리가 먼저 인지했지만 미군 당국과 분석을 진행하는 사이 일본이 서둘러 발표한 겁니다. In other words, Japan reported first, but it knew nothing tangible about it. This is the most important part in missile defense, because knowing things like speed, altitude, trajectory of the missile is what allows you to pinpoint its location and intercept the missile just KNOWING that the missile launched is pointless. If you don't know its speed, how can your ABMs intercept the missile in time? If you don't know its altitude, how can you even identify the missile's location? The questions go on and on. The article also states that South Korea acquiesced to share the intel with Japan because the GSOMIA still technically active until it hits the expiration date the decision made by the Moon administration is to not renew it and allow it to expire. Of course, there are those who might argue that this might be a lie because it came from a Korean news source, so I took the liberty of bringing a Japanese news source as well The English version of the Kyodo News reports the following - click here for link The missiles, fired at 6 45 a.m. and 7 02 a.m., flew about 380 kilometers at a top speed of Mach 6.5 and reached a maximum altitude of about 97 km, Yonhap News Agency quoted the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying. Prior to the ROK government announcing the specs of the missile launch, NO Japanese media had reported on the exact speed, range, altitude, and duration of the missile. In fact, if you use google, you can use the search engine and check how many hours ago each news link was posted. And when you do, you'll see that Japanese media did not post anything tangible about the missile launch before the details came out from South Korea. The Kyodo News also confirms that yes, Japan DID request missile intel to South Korea. The South Korean JCS said it intends to share intelligence on the latest North Korean missile launches with Japan upon Tokyo's request. I'll stop here, since I think this speaks for itself about who REALLY needs GSOMIA the most. But I'll leave behind one last commentary made by the KBS reporter in the aforementioned link above 일본 정부는 지소미아가 종료돼도 별다른 영향이 없을 거라고 큰소리쳤습니다. 하지만 막상 상황이 닥치자 채 하루도 안 돼 우리에게 슬그머니 손을 내밀고 대안을 찾느라 분주한 모양샙니다. After the GSOMIA has come to a conclusion, Japan boasted that it would have little effect. But it appears that as soon as the reality came crashing down, it didn't even take a whole day for Japan to hold out its hand to ask for help and scramble to find alternatives for GSOMIA

Content: What s next for North Korea? Pre 2018, war with North Korea and it s collapse seemed like an inevitability. Tensions were at boiling point and the world was anxious about what the DPRK will do next. However in 2018, the world breathed a sigh of relief, as the tensions relaxed and North Korea had diplomatic talks with both South Korea and their greatest enemy America. Since then we haven t really heard much about North Korea compared to what we have seen throughout the rest of the 2010s. What will it be like for them going into the future? Will they maintain this detent with SK and the West? Will they liberalise? How are they going to cope with the rapid technological change the world will see in the coming decades?

Title: Why has Singapore managed to resist the wave of democratization of Taiwan and South Korea in the early 90s?
Content: Why has Singapore managed to resist the wave of democratization of Taiwan and South Korea in the early 90s? Basically at the end of the Cold War, US pressure managed to force South Korea and Taiwan to reform their authoritarian governments into liberal democracies with fully competitive multiparty elections, how has Singapore resisted this and still has a political system that is barely changed compared to when Lee Kuan Yew officially stepped down. Basically since the end of the Cold War, Singapore is still an illiberal democracy and is still stuck in place as a partially free country, while Taiwan and South Korea have become full liberal democracies with fully competitive elections, with no dominant single party, unlike Singapore. Why has no comparative pressure been exerted on Singapore by the US to democratize, unlike Taiwan and South Korea, or if pressure has been exerted by the West and the US, how has Singapore's political establishment managed to successfully resist this and maintains its managed or illiberal democracy, where there are multiparty elections on paper but they are not competitive in any serious sense of the word. And unlike Taiwan and South Korea, why has there been no demand by a clear majority of the populace for its political system to be liberalized like in South Korea and Taiwan?

As soon as they denied us our rights as Britons by not representing us, all France had to do to kick Britain in the ass was to get friendly with us. Could we do the same thing? North Korea isn't technically a part of China so maybe we can get friendly with them. Kim can tell his people that the missiles are meant for us, but we can pull the strings so those missiles point at Beijing!

Content: North Korea nuclear talks After almost 3 decades of failed U.S.-led efforts to curtail North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Trump tried to brake the stalemate with sort of "bromance diplomacy", however, three summits, several tweets, and many month later, the US seem to have found itself back in familiar waters. This is emphasized by Recent statements from North Korea. Suggesting that the good relationship between Trump and Kim has thus far not translated into improved government-to-government relations or progress on denuclearization. Questions, any thought on where this is going? Does North Korea holds most of the cards or president Trump is juggling to many crisis or something else ?

However, in the face of a quickly crumbling US-led world order and an increasingly authoritarian PRC, how likely is it that China will openly support North Korea once again?

Title: Can We Expect South Korea-Japan Tensions to Cool in Coming Years?
Content: Can We Expect South Korea-Japan Tensions to Cool in Coming Years? Japan and South Korea have had a tumultuous relationship, defined in equal measure by their joint dependence on US security assurances, and the post-colonial legacy of Japanese occupation up until the end of World War Two. In recent month, the latter has flared up again, with disputes on culpability for war atrocities leading to a considerable trade and security dispute between the two. It has now been nearly 85 years since the end of Japanese occupation in South Korea, yet the matter continues to define their bilateral relationship. This is not to minimise the actions of the Japanese Empire during this period the atrocities committed were a crime against humanity and must be remembered as such. At the same time, anyone who committed said atrocities are now, to the best of my knowledge, dead. So my question is, as the atrocities committed begin to pass from living memory, can we expect to see a thawing if tensions? Or has this matter now become so culturally engrained on both sides that it will continue to cause divisions for the foreseeable future? And I apologise if this question comes across as blunt or insensitive, it is just the inquiry of an outsider with no experience of these living through these debates.

Content: Of the countries that the U.S. has very poor diplomatic relations with, why hasn't there been sudden increased tension with Cuba under the Trump administration unlike with North Korea, Iran and Venezuela? Except the trade war with China which is not nearly as existentially threatening and Russia being friendly with Trump, in nearly four years of Trump administration, North Korea, Iran and Venezuela are basically the ones whose relations with US have teetered to heightened military tensions. Cuba seems to have been the remarkable exception with Trump only issuing travel restrictions to Cuba 1 2 and thereby also, in effect, de facto reimposing some economic sanctions to the country which the Cubans are already accustomed to. Does Cuba have some sort of leverage to insulate themselves from further American influence, or is Cuba simply out of Trump's immediate concern?

Title: How developed is North Korea?
Content: How developed is North Korea? If you look at official HDI records. North Korea should have a medium level of human development at 0.766 or 0.733 on par with Latin American countries . If you actually calculate the HDI of North Korea though given life expectancy and GDP per capita you get a much lower number 0.583 which is below many African countries. x200B If you google search pictures of North Korea, it seems quite developed and urbanized. But then again if you google search the capitals of poor African countries you get the same results. I can't find a lot of pictures of rural life in North Korea, but given this night-time photo of North Korea and its lights, it is needless to say electricity is not common in the country. x200B My question is what effect are continuous sanctions having on North Korea's socioeconomic development? And how is North Korea maintaining its military if its budget is dwarfed by many African nations? Does North Korea have a shadow economy fueled by slave labor perhaps? Or are there hidden factors that some of the few published numbers of North Korea do not reveal?

Title: Are DPRK, ROK, US, China interests (in Korean Peninsula) fundamentally incompatible, or?
Content: Are DPRK, ROK, US, China interests in Korean Peninsula fundamentally incompatible, or? Are DPRK, ROK, US, China interests in Korean Peninsula fundamentally incompatible? Or is there a potential intersection of interests that's sufficient to "permanently" resolve tensions, but there's just great difficulty in getting from here to there? What even are the various parties' interests? China, from what I read, is primarily interested in not having a large American military presence and or a powerful American military ally right up against its border? US interest, I guess, is primarily to maintain alliance with ROK that gives US military and economic influence in the region desire to end reduce military tensions hostilities on peninsula desire for DPRK to stop "acting like a rogue nation"? ROK interest, presumably, is primarily end to military tensions hostilities with DPRK, ultimately the dream of re-unification, and preservation of its economic political system? DPRK interest, maybe, is just the flip side of ROK interest? Permanent end to tensions with ROK and US, in way that maintains DPRK political economics structures and interests? Or does DPRK need to preserve the military conflict in order to perpetuate its leadership? Does DPRK care about reunification? Well, if my assumptions here are reasonably correct, it looks like there's a conflict between China's desires to have a buffer, and the US desire to have overseas military influence on the Korean peninsula ... or at least that preservation of DPRK is necessary to resolve the conflict. Reunification seems off the table for the foreseeable future, since it's incompatible with preservation of the two political economic structures. Okay, maybe parties' mutual interests require preservation of DPRK, but I don't see any fundamental interests that require continuation of the state of military hostility. Am I badly misreading the situation? Does China need for DPRK ROK hostilities to continue, because if relations become friendly then there's too much risk of DPRK failing to serve as the needed buffer?

It also made me realise how such a virus, if it get out of hands, could be devasting for such a country. I remember seeing some news about NK calling back their staff from africa as ebola appeared.

Title: [Question] Who are the persons behind channels like Phuong DPRK Daily
Content: Question Who are the persons behind channels like Phuong DPRK Daily For years I've seen few channels like this poping up and disapearing on YT posting KCTV content. Theres is Phuong DPRK and Stimmekoreas not sure about the spelling which has been deleted. In the channel description the person say that he is german with north korean roots, I remember that the stimmekorea channel owner also said or something made us guess that he was a german or germanspeaker at least so It's probably the same person or group of people behind it. So now I'm wondering are these trolls ? very unlikely imo Are these germans with NK roots genuily supporting the DPRK or are these channels part of a propaganda strategy runned from pyongyang or diplomats elsewhere ? Could it be a personal initiative from an high ranking official or diplomat ? It's also interesting to note that they claimed to be german. We know about the "ties" between switzerland and NK and also that there is an embassy in Berlin which means diplomats with a potential access to the internet. There was also this one but all the videos were deleted More details here

Title: As they have surpassed Japan, what do you think will surpass the US, China, or South Korea as technological leaders in the coming decades?
Content: As they have surpassed Japan, what do you think will surpass the US, China, or South Korea as technological leaders in the coming decades? The decline of the Japanese electronics industry was mentioned in this subreddit yesterday. throwaway_firstie Japan has totally missed the new digital revolution and I do not think it is likely that they will catch up. When you think of the most advanced smartphone designs, laptop manufacturers, chipmakers, 5G vendors etc., top consumer electronics manufacturers and designers, you won't find many Japanese companies on top. Chinese Taiwan included and Korean companies are the new kings of technology. Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, TSMC, LG, Acer, ASUS dictate the field of technology, not Sony. The Chinese are more vigorous in pursuing machine learning and AI as well as automation than the Japanese are. Wechat, Tencent, Alibaba are all successful Mainland Chinese startups and some of the most valuable companies in the world. In fact, if you look at the tech that Japan is good at, you'll find that it is a holdover from the 1980s and 1990s. Vehicle manufacturing and video games. But even in vehicle manufacturing, Japan is facing strong competition from its neighbors. BYD, Geely, Kia, Hyundai are all catching up fast to the Japanese giants. The days of everybody holding a Japanese Walkman, using a Japanese computer, listening to tapes on a Japanese radio and relying on Japanese transistors are long gone. The small technological lead in some fields that Japan still has is fast becoming obsolete. same person My guess as to why this has happened is simply that the Japanese became complacent. This development is ironic considering how tough and hard-driving their working culture is. Anecdotally, I think that Tokyo looks like it is stuck in the 1990s while Shanghai and Seoul are the symbols of modernity in Asia and this is symbolic of the legacy of the lost decade that they have never been able to recover from. Their population isn't "hungry" enough for success unlike their neighbors who were living in crushing poverty until fairly recently and this has an effect on their innovation. Will China, South Korea, and the United States with Silicon Valley remain as the "kings of technology"? If not, who will catch up and surpass them?

Title: [Question] Navy SEALs in the DPRK?
Content: Question Navy SEALs in the DPRK? Anyone have sources of the SEALs or other US government forces doing operations in the DPRK? I was listening to a podcast The Unexplained with Howard Hughes Episode 424 and the guest mentioned speaking with a former SEAL who did an operation to disable a nuclear warhead that North Korea had acquired from Belarus after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Here is a tiny bit of info, lacking detail, on the SEAL, but mostly promoting a fictionalized book they were doing x200B Anyways, I'd be fascinated to learn about SEAL or other US forces working inside North Korea.

Title: Why does the dprk make so many incorrect statements about the flaws of the United States?
Content: Why does the dprk make so many incorrect statements about the flaws of the United States? I live in Redwood City, California, in the United States of America. My city is a substance use fueled, twisted hell farce. We give little, if any attention to the dprk. However, the dprk gives great attention to us. In it, the dprk is tirelessly critical, and they tirelessly make incorrect statements about the flaws of the United States of America. For example, they accuse us of using three pointed spear against prisoners. However, what we use against prisoners is actually power drill, and the Trident is not a three-pointed spear, it's a submarine launched ballistic missile. There's much to criticize about my country in the public record. For example, the meat in fast food is undercooked, and cattle feces abounds there. Also, there are even feces themed toys for sale in the United States. However, I think the dprk does not want to criticize the United States, because they get it so wrong. How can anyone criticize something so easily criticized correctly so incorrectly?

If Kim Jong Un dies with no clear successor, will China have enough influence in the North Korean leadership to effect a diplomatic merger, or exploit the power vacuum to stage a coup and achieve the same result? Or could the PLA simply enter North Korea during the chaos and occupy it? Considering how fortified the DMZ is and the concentration of the North Korean forces on the south, would South Korea and the US be able to occupy North Korea first or prevent China from doing so?

Basically in 2005, Iran and NK played each other but at the end of the game the NK team was angry that the refs wouldn t give them a free kick over a supposed Iranian penalty. After this the NK player got a red card and the fans threw bottles and chairs to the field. They rooted against the Iranians so bad the Pyongyang riot police had to go and stop it. That s the most prominent example of social disruption I can think of in NK. I know there were pictures of this event because when I looked all of that up they linked to a website with pictures this time but the website has been taken over by an SEO bit since 2014. So I can t find any other pics, anyone know of any on the web?

Title: What would happen if the US pulled out of the Korean peninsula, would it make things better or worse?
Content: What would happen if the US pulled out of the Korean peninsula, would it make things better or worse? I'm no expert on North Korea but I would imagine that either of the two situations could happen. 1 . China decreases its support towards North Korea if American influence in the Korean peninsula decreases and North Korea has no choice but to negotiate with South Korea over reunification. A unified Korea will also mean that North Koreans will be less likely to cause a refugee crisis in China. 2 . Sensing vulnerability, North Korea starts attacking South Korea as its security decreases. China could support North Korean attacks on South Korea behind closed doors due to the capitalistic influence over South Korea. But this may also not happen as the NK regime are strategic and would surely know that their Southern counterparts will beat them in terms of resources.

Title: The Geopolitics of North Korea ---- The Red Line
Content: The Geopolitics of North Korea ---- The Red Line Myself and my team just finished an hour-long deep-dive show into the Geopolitics of North Korea, its foreign policy and what it means for the region. We also take a look into the likely outcomes of war, and where their nuclear program is up to at the moment. For this episode we have ERIC GOMEZ CATO Institutes director of Defence Policy Studies and East Asia expert JACOB BOGEL Founder of AccessDPRK. The worlds most detailed open-source map of the DPRK SOO KIM RAND Corporation, CIA and the Department of Homeland Securities North Korea expert. One of the main focuses of the piece is about how important the nuclear program is to the Kim family, and how it completely changes the balance of power in the peninsula. We also go into what China, Russia, South Korea and the US are all hoping to gain from North Korea, and wether they are likely to achieve it. We even sat down with Eric and gamed out what a war between the North and South would actually look like, and the results were pretty surprising. Its designed to be a crash course on everything you would need to know about the situation, and we learned a lot making it. We also decided to leave in some of the more controversial points, such as the NKs missile count, submarine programs and US nuclear response plan. The show is really starting to pick up and this sub was a huge help in gathering guests and info so I thought I would share it here to say thanks. Would love your input and feedback as well.

Title: Is George W. Bush indirectly responsible for North Korea's progress with nuclear weapons?
Content: Is George W. Bush indirectly responsible for North Korea's progress with nuclear weapons? North Korea's nuclear weapons programs seems to have taken off after George Bush declared them part of an "Axis of Evil" and invaded a country that was part of this perceived coalition Iraq . Prior to this North Korea seemed to see Nuclear weapons as desirable but not an urgent need. Its progress seemed very sluggish compared to events after 2002. It would make sense that Kim Jong-il would want nukes after seeing what happened to Saddam Hussein. I read a long time ago that Bush only included North Korea in the "axis of evil" speech for politically correct reasons. That being he did not want to be perceived as targeting only Islamic countries in the war on terror. And thus the threat to North Korea was only superficial and had no actual intentions on regime change. Hence I am using the term indirectly.

Title: What are South Korea-US relations like today?
Content: What are South Korea-US relations like today? I ve become curious as to how strong or what is the current state of US-South Korean relations. This might be outdated but I ve read several articles on the THAAD issues from last year. For those who don t know this was when the US sent THAAD a missile defensive system to South Korea to counter any potential North Korean threat. However this was met with great disagreement with China and the South Korean people. China claimed that these missile defense system can be used as radar by the US military and spy on China. I m not entirely sure if thats possible, but either way China ultimately placed severe sanction on South Korea and had economically damaged the country for a brief time. This somewhat strained China-South Korea relations, and South Koreans weren t particularly happy with the implementation of the defense system either as they believed it would only instigate tensions between the North and South. I also know there has been recent controversy in Trump wanting the South Korean government to increase their spending on having US troops stationed in the South. This of course was also met with sever criticism by South Koreans in general against the US and Trump. There have also been talks with the South opening more with China and wanting to open itself more to Russia. With all this in mind, can someone give me an insight of the current relations between the US and South? Despite these issues and topics, would this affect relations between the two in the long run? Could the South aim to rely more on China and Russia rather than the US? Please give me some of your own inputs and opinions on this topic, thank you.

Title: Possibility of. DPRK civil war?
Content: Possibility of. DPRK civil war? The talk in the past few weeks about a possible successor to Un, and I thought that the question about next in line for chairperson of the party. I think it s commonly accepted that Kim Yo-Jong would take over, but this transfer of power would be completely new to the country. The transfer of power hitherto has been from father to son, and in the case of Jong rising to power, the transfer of power would be between siblings. Would the people put faith in a brother-sister transfer of power? Could there be a portion of the population that would support Jong as the rightful leader and another portion that supports Un s oldest child son as the true leader? Would citizens just support whoever has control of the government at the moment because they have no other choice? TLDR cloud there be a split between citizens pledging allegiance to Kim Yo-jong vs Un s oldest child son if the need for a new leader arises?

Title: If North Korea was incorporated into the South, how long do you think it would take for living standards to significantly improve?
Content: If North Korea was incorporated into the South, how long do you think it would take for living standards to significantly improve? Not that it's likely to happen in the foreseeable future, but I was curious how long others here suspect it would take for living standards to improve to mostly the level of South Korea, and culture to become mostly similar to the South, if Korea was to reunify, with North Korea ceasing to exist, much like when East Germany was incorporated into the West in 1990? In former East Germany this took only about 5-10 years however the living standard gap between the two Germanys was smaller East Germany had better living conditions than North Korea - the average DDR citizen earned around 1 3 that of somebody in West Germany whereas the average North Korean earns just 1 50 of an average South Korean , the majority of East Germans were more exposed to Western media than North Koreans are and the East German state had a less extreme ideology than that of North Korea DDR citizens never considered their Party leader a living deity, for instance . I suspect it would probably take around 20 years for North Korea to feel mostly similar to the South if the two reunited like East and West Germany did. North Korea may initially see a brief drop in living standards as many people are made unemployed from formerly state owned factories and offices, but that would probably be accompanied by a large aid programme. I'd imagine there would also be an influx of people moving to the South, which is already more densely populated. The majority of propaganda would almost certainly be removed within days or weeks of reunification and South Korean Western chains would probably begin opening branches within former North Korean cities within months, however the South Korean government would probably continue operating the existing state owned department stores for several years to smoothen the transition from a socialist to a capitalist economy. There would also almost certainly be a lot of construction like we saw in former eastern Germany during the 1990s. It would be interesting to hear your opinions on this.

The amount of people who are studying Korean has tripled. Korean shows and movies are becoming more globally popular, Parasite won several Oscars. Kpop is a growing force that seems to be unstoppable. Social media is now filled with kpop fans and kpop seems like it ll be entering the mainstream of foreign music markets. It seems like South Korea was able to just overtake Japan in the span of a decade, how was a tiny country like South Korea able to have this much influence globally?

Content: How feasible is the Seoul-Pyongyang 2032 Olympic bid? Could North Korea really host such an international event? or is this just some crazy fantasy Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in both came up with during their peace summit? It would be great if it happens and all goes smoothly, but I am not very optimistic ATM.

Content: There is definitely something up with Kim Jong-Un's left arm. Following from our last discussion here I have found another photo of Kim Jong-Un during the same event. See here - Pyongyang Sports Factory. Two photo comparison. Both photos show the same thing. His upper left forearm starts going red. It is definitely not a shadow as some thought. Very odd.

Title: An Interesting speech by Kim Jong-Un on the economy
Content: An Interesting speech by Kim Jong-Un on the economy I found this an interesting read. Part of Kim Jong-Un's early public orders for the economy. Here we have an unusual admission of food problems and poor energy infrastructure. "In order to build a thriving socialist country true to the earnest instructions of General Kim Jong Il, we should solve, before anything else, the problem of food for the people to this end, we should obtain all the arable land possible and, while positively expanding its area, increase the unit-area yield of crops. Land that can be brought under cultivation can be found everywhere. A man, who strives to find reclaimable land and increases the area of land under cultivation by even an inch, is a genuine patriot. We should continue to put great efforts into reclaiming tidal flats as a way of expanding the area of land under cultivation. The tidal flats we are planning to reclaim amount to 300,000 hectares. We should give precedence to reclaiming those with good conditions for building embankments and good prospects for being turned into arable land soon, and should build networks of facilities there immediately afterwards so as to bring them under cultivation. As the reclaiming of tidal flats is a huge and difficult undertaking to transform nature, we should pay national concern to it and take comprehensive steps to ensure the supply of enough equipment and materials, including lorries, fuel and cement. We should complete the remaining land realignment projects. These projects have been undertaken across the country under the leadership of General Kim Jong Il, but there are still small patches of fields in the far corners of the countryside. Provinces should realign by themselves these neglected patches and hand them down to posterity. The General said that, after completing these land realignment projects, the electricity pylons scattered over the paddy and nonpaddy fields should be relocated, but his instructions are yet to be fully carried out. True to his instructions, we should relocate the electricity pylons that have been erected haphazardly." Source Kim Jong-Un - Talk to Senior State Economic Organs and Working People s Organizations April 27, 2012 PS I get the impression that he is falsely quoting his late father here so it does not give the public the impression its him making these admissions.

Title: Interesting insight into the lead up of the Korean War.
Content: Interesting insight into the lead up of the Korean War. The following is a translated report on Kim Il Sung s visit to the USSR from March 30th to April 25th , 1950. Produced by the Soviet Central Committee s International Department. x200B "Comrade Stalin confirmed to Kim Il Sung that the international environment has sufficiently changed to permit a more active stance on the unification of Korea. Internationally, the Chinese Communist Party s victory over the Guomindang has improved the environment for actions in Korea. China is no longer busy with internal fighting and can devote its attention and energy to the assistance of Korea. If necessary, China has at its disposal troops which can be utilized in Korea without any harm to the other needs of China. The Chinese victory is also important psychologically. It has proved the strength of Asian revolutionaries, and shown the weakness of Asian reactionaries and their mentors in the West, in America. Americans left China and did not dare to challenge the new Chinese authorities militarily. Now that China has signed a treaty of alliance with the USSR, Americans will be even more hesitant to challenge the Communists in Asia. According to information coming from the United States, it is really so. The prevailing mood is not to interfere. Such a mood is reinforced by the fact that the USSR now has the atomic bomb and that our positions are solidified in Pyongyang. However, we have to weigh once again all the pros and cons of the liberation. First of all, will Americans interfere or not? Second, the liberation can be started only if the Chinese leadership endorses it. Kim Il Sung expressed his opinion that Americans won t interfere. Now that they know that the USSR and China are behind Korea and are able to help it, Americans will not risk a big war. As for Comrade Mao Zedong, he always supported our desire to liberate the whole country. Comrade Mao Zedong said on a number of occasions that after the Chinese revolution is completed, China will help us, if necessary, it will provide troops. However, we want to rely on our own forces to unify Korea. We believe that we can do it. Comrade Stalin emphasized that a thorough preparation for war was a must. First of all, armed forces have to be elevated to an upper level of preparedness. You have to form elite attack divisions as well as create additional units. Divisions have to have more weapons, more mechanized means of movement and combat. Your request in this respect will be fully satisfied. Then a detailed plan of the offensive must be drawn. Basically it has to have three stages. 1. Troops are concentrated in the designated areas, close to the 38th parallel. 2. The highest bodies of power in North Korea make fresh proposals for peaceful unification. These will certainly be rejected by the other side. Then, after they are rejected, a counterattack must take place. I agree with your idea to engage the adversary in the Ongjin peninsula as it will help to disguise who initiated the combat activities. After you attack and the South counterattacks it would give you a chance to enlarge the front. The war should be quick and speedy. Southerners and Americans should not have time to come to their senses. They won t have time to put up a strong resistance and to mobilize international support. Comrade Stalin added that Koreans should not count on direct Soviet participation in the war because the USSR had serious challenges elsewhere to cope with, especially in the West. He again urged Kim Il Sung to consult with Mao Zedong and mentioned that the Chinese leader had a good understanding of Oriental matters. Stalin repeated that the USSR was not ready to get involved in Korean affairs directly, especially if Americans did venture to send troops to Korea. Kim Il Sung gave a more detailed analysis of why Americans would not interfere. The attack will be swift and the war will be won in three days the guerilla movement in the South has grown stronger and a major uprising can be expected. Americans won t have time to prepare and by the time they come to their senses, all the Korean people will be enthusiastically supporting the new government. Pak Hon-yong elaborated on the thesis of a strong guerilla movement in South Korea. He predicted that 200,000 party members will participate as leaders of the mass uprising. It was agreed that the North Korean army would be fully mobilized by the summer of 1950 and by that time the Korean General Staff, with the assistance of Soviet advisers, will draw the concrete plan for the offensive. " Needless to say, its very damning for the Norths present narrative of the war. What struck me as odd is that Mao and Stalin are predominantly referred to as " Comrade Stalin" and " Comrade Mao" but not once is Kim il-sung. I wonder why that is?

Title: The first South Korean allowed to document North Korea opened my eyes towards the average North Korean citizen, how much do you think it was staged?
Content: The first South Korean allowed to document North Korea opened my eyes towards the average North Korean citizen, how much do you think it was staged? Here's the documentary This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if I'm doing something wrong. But this is by far the most detailed documentary about North Korea. I've watched just about every youtube documentary about North Korea from copyrighted BBC ABC documentaries to Independent film makers on youtube, but I have NEVER seen North Korean citizens as open as in this documentary. What particularly hit me was when she was interviewing the factory worker who wants to make her own clothes for the North Korean people and if she works hard enough, she might be recommended a vacation to Pyongyang. We hear so much about how "Pyongyang" is only for the "entitled" and this video kind of shows how that process works. I'm sorry if I'm downvoted but I'm genuinely interested in North Korea and this Youtube documentary opened a whole new perspective of North Korea, I couldn't help but share it. TL DR - The North Koreans opened up to this South Korean 110 more than any Western journalist has achieved. How much do you think this was staged?

Content: Throughout the Korean War, just how effective were the Student Soldiers of South Korea? Yesterday I was watching Battle of Jangsari and now I m currently rewatching 71 Into the Fire. I ve always found the Student Soldier system program in South Korea during the Korean War to be fascinating since if I right now was a Korean kid during the Korean War, I d probably join the Student Soldier program if I couldn t join the ROKA or ROKMC. But I ve always wondered just how effective these Student Soldiers were in battle. I know that they received like two weeks of really basic rudimentary military training but what were they typically tasked with doing? Why weren t these high schoolers just drafted into the regular Army? How was the entire thing run throughout the course of the war? Based on what I ve seen, Student Soldiers seem to have left an almost heroic mark on recent Korean military history so they must ve been pretty impactful but exactly how capable were they during battles?

However, I find it confusing and a little hypocritical that the international community has largely accepted their nuclear arsenals while condemning and sanctioning Iran and North Korea. It's especially weird when you consider that India and Pakistan are arguably more likely to use their nuclear weapons in war than Iran or North Korea.

This means that, if South Korea ever desires IRBM's or ICBM's, they'll have the technology or even convertible platforms depending on the size and transportability of said "SLV's" ready. The economic arguments for solid propellant SLV's are dubious too. Unless it's mostly government-controlled projects, the motor manufacturers traditionally charge too much compared to liquid propellant solutions to the SLV integrators.

According to this New York Times article from February 1992, North Koreans outside Pyongyang had almost had to starve from 1991, so the famine that was said to begin in 1994 actually began long before that.

Title: Is it true that Seoul had been the capital of the DPRK in 1948-1972?
Content: Is it true that Seoul had been the capital of the DPRK in 1948-1972? I have seen such a statement on Quora, yet unsourced. Can anyone confirm it? The choice of the capital is quite peculiar. 1, On the one hand, Seoul had been the capital of the Choson dynasty since 1392 CE. And Kaesong was the capital of Goryeoin 919-1390. 2. On the other, Pyongyang had been the capital of Goguryeo since 427 CE. 3. Pyongyang was allegedly the capital of Gojoseon starting in 2333 BCE. 4. The birthplace of Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung is Mangyongdae, near Pyongyang. Obviously, I mean a technicality, jurisprudence. The same way that the entirety of the Korean peninsula, Jejudo and Ulleungdo belong to the DPRK de jure or how Stepanakert is in Azerbaijan .

Title: Vatican diplomacy and South Korea
Content: Vatican diplomacy and South Korea The Vatican city is one of the tiniest sovereign states in the world, yet its influence far outstrips its size. The Pope is the head of the largest religious denomination on earth and his influence - although quite diminished - is still relevant. The birth and recognition of South Korea as a sovereign state is one good example of the Vatican's influence. Therefore, it is an interesting subject to delve into. In 1947, the Vatican was the first state which officially recognized the Republic of Korea even before its official proclamation as such The Republic of Korea was formally established in August 15, 1948 . Back then, the Papacy sent bishop Patrick Byrne as Apostolic visitor to South Korea and with him an official letter which supported the establishment of South Korea as a sovereign state. South Korea did not stay idle either. Chang Myon, who later became the first ambassador to the United States, was a devout Catholic himself, and he actively sought the support of the Vatican and other Catholic countries. In 1948, He was sent to Paris for the third plenary meeting of the United Nations in order to amass support for the new republic. It was an arduous task since Korea was virtually an unknown place in those times, and little attention was paid to him. However, Pope Pius XII took interest and he sent letters advising other Europeans and Latin Americans to assist him. Of course, Chang Myon was also an extraordinary man. He came from a relatively wealthy family, as he was one of the very few who had the luxury of studying abroad. Back in those times, Korea was annexed by Japan and the majority of the population was still rural. Yet, he was a graduate from Manhattan College and was the first delegate to pay visit to Rome representing the Korean youth. After returning from America, he proselytized to other Koreans and helped bishop Patrick in his evangelizing mission. Their friendship was a lasting one, and this intimacy proved to be useful when Chang Myon was sent to Paris and to Rome. Since then, South Korea's relation with the Vatican remained cordial and big figures of South Korean history had intimate relations with the Church. For example, former president Kim Dae-Jung 1998 2003 , was also a devout Catholic Chang Myon introduced him to the new faith and he was helped by the Church when his life was in danger. Back in the 70 80s, South Korea was ruled by a military dictatorship, and Kim Dae-Jung was sentenced to death. But the sentence backfired when the Pope John Paul II himself intervened for his life. The Korean cardinal Kim Soo-Hwan also gave tacit support to the democratic movement of the 1980s by sheltering many student activists at Myong-dong Cathedral in Seoul. The current president Moon Jae-In is also known to be a devout believer and he sent one of his closest aides to the Vatican as ambassador of Korea. His name is Lee Baek-Man and considering his resume, he could easily have been an influential politician serving as a cabinet member or as a presidential advisor, yet he was sent to the Vatican. 3 years have past since he was installed as ambassador and there are no signs of him coming back. It is quite a strange situation, since normally, ambassadors to the Vatican are not...say high profile figures. Nevertheless, South Korea views the Vatican in high regard and many influential politicians do not shy away from expressing their religious beliefs. Similar stories may not be confined only to South Korea. The Vatican is a global player with a history which dates back to centuries if not millennia. It would be interesting to take a serious look on how the Vatican exercises its influence and which are its tools.

Title: Do south Korean far-right ultranationalists ("Ilbe?") hate the DPRK? If yes, why? (Genuine question)
Content: Do south Korean far-right ultranationalists "Ilbe?" hate the DPRK? If yes, why? Genuine question Please, don't take me for a troll. I'm just a casual observer from Ukraine, and I probably sound offensive. I only want to learn. From what I understand, both the north and the south are nationalist although southerners less so, as they support America and Japan . The main difference is economics - central planning vs corporate capitalism. But what's about the radical nationalists in the south they're called Ilbe? ? Can they not see that the DPRK has the best interests of the Korean race in mind? Isn't it obvious that it is the legacy of Dear Leader Kim Jong Il that has granted Korea the blessed nuclear sword as the Marshall has called it ? The south has clearly a weaker position as regards foreign powers and the defence of the nation the nuclear south might change it, do they want it? . I have read that the Ilbe people hate the communists from Jeollado and Jejudo? . Why is that a thing? Why do they value capitalism at all? Do they prioritise the GDP and economics over the well-being of their race? I have heard, these people are misogynist. Then don't they love how so many women in the north wear traditional colourful dresses, and sing beautiful songs? Whereas southern women wear skimpy, sexualised outfits, and rap like Americans in ugly voices. Yes, Americans call feminists communist, but that's clearly ridiculous - do the Korean nationalists make the same mistake of conflating the two ideas? The DPRK female liberation looks absolutely nothing like those period blood marches outside its territory. Also, I have heard that the only anti-Americans in the south are the Left, whereas all right-wingers adore everything American. Does it apply to the ultranationalists, too? Is there not a single right faction that would want Americans out and maybe fight the DPRK on equal terms ? That would view inviting foreign troops as treason, and as cheating Darwinism? Do the southern ultranationalists at least treasure the utter lack of foreigners in the northern DPRK? Do they celebrate the abortions of Chinese Korean defector kids? And lastly, what do the southern ultranationalists think of Christianity? And lack thereof in the DPRK? After all, it's a foreign desert religion. And do they regard Paektusan as the sacred mountain? Again, please, can I get a response in a dignified tone? Without "muh' human rights violations", and without calling misogynists "losers"? I genuinely want to learn about the world, not the party line about who is evil and which questions are evil. If anything, I would much prefer the praise of capitalism than the constant denigration of either the DPRK or the Ilbe.

Title: Who runs the Pyongyang subreddit?
Content: Who runs the Pyongyang subreddit? I have suspected for a while that it s run by the DPRK. Reason being, the sole moderator has been on reddit for almost 10 years and done literally nothing but post links to official DPRK news outlets and censor the community approving only positive serious or not comments about North Korea. If it s not run by NK then I find it difficult to fathom someone being that committed and for what? It would be trolling of the highest order. What do you guys think?

Content: How long would it take for a newly-freed North Korea to get the same standard of living as the South? I mean, I feel it would be a lot longer than the South if only because the South didn't have heads of state that were revered by mostly everybody and just the general brainwashing. Industry and such seems to me like it would take far less time to build up.

Content: Did the DPRK propaganda mention the 2016 Park Geun-hye scandal SKorean president controlled by literal witches ? I wonder whether the DPRK propaganda focuses on the most insane features of the capitalist society to the south - weird cults, witches controlling presidents, Megalia women getting pregnant to abort fetuses... You know, the juicy stuff. The kind you won't believe. Do they talk about it at all? To my mind, it's a propagandist's gold mine. Unless this debauchery is too unbelievable and obscene to tender Juche Koreans' ears, of course. Then it's kind of sad, as the reality at hand is far more hilarious than fiction.

Title: Any info on this book? I found it today and haven’t had any luck trying to find any details on it. It was printed in North Korea in 1984 by Nada Takashi. It shows North Korean propaganda. If anyone knows more information about it, that would be great, please share! Thank you.

Title: So, my grandfathers brother from Serbia fought in the Korean War...
Content: So, my grandfathers brother from Serbia fought in the Korean War... Hi guys! To elaborate, this wouldn t be much of a surprise if, in fact, he was from the USA, UK or any other allied country from back then, but he was from Serbia, which was back then part of communist Yugoslavia! Now, before i explain, i would like to tell about how i found out about this so i was looking at some old photos that i have recovered from my grandpa s village cabin and found a picture of his brother, Mihajlo, in an army uniform alongside with some people who looked Asian. I asked my grandpa where the photo was taken and he told me that it was from Inčon which sounded quite weird to me because i am unfamiliar with that name, or at least i was until i realised he meant Incheon. I asked him what the hell his brother was doing there back then and then he told me an interesting story. After WW2 in Yugoslavia ended, or, to be price, in the last days of WW2, Soviet Army took some of the credits for liberation of Yugoslavia even tho it was already almost completely liberated by local militia. As they saw themselves as our liberators , they often took advantage of our women, they took our food, supplies etc. One of those women was 13 year old Violeta, my grandfathers sister. During the so called liberation , Soviet troops did horrible things to her and eventually, they killed her. She was only 13! So her older brother, middle child in the family, my grandads younger brother, developed a huge hatred for Soviet army. He promised to her on her grave that he will revenge her somehow. So the years passed and evetually he found out that there is a war in Korea between communist North and pro American South. Now, he wasn t big of a fan of the USA as well but he absolutely despised communists. He smuggled himself onto one of the USA merchant ships in Free Town of Trieste in the 50s after Tito-Stalin split, Yugoslavia became more pro-USA so seeing USA military and merchant marine ships was a common sight and travelled from one place to another until he came to Philippines and eventually arrived to Korean peninsula as a volonter fighting for the US troops. He fought for just a couple of months until he was fataly wounded and died. Because of the war, he was burried somewhere in South Korea and his brother, my grandfather, only found out about that almost 10 years later when his fellow comrade, USA trooper wrote to my grandpa. He wrote that his brother was a brave man, smoked way too much cigarettes and never saw such hatred towards ruskies in someones eyes in his entire life . Troopers name was or still is if he is alive Timothy Page and he is from Wisconsin unfortunatelly that s all he knows about him . Unfortunatelly, i have no idea where he was burried but i would love to know and visit his grave once, maybe bring him a pack of cigarettes So yeah, my grandpa travelled almost half of the globe to help out fellow South Koreans and died in foreign mans land, but i am proud of him. I hope mods won t delete this post if i broke any rules, i truly do hope that i haven t, and i really tried my best to explain and write everything as best as i can, it s really late here. Also, if someone wants, i can get that picture from him and post it here or anywhere else And also, i hope you don t mind my broken English, love from Serbia to you all!

Title: Andrei Lankov - Why part of me will miss Trump’s ignorant and eccentric approach to North Korea
Content: Andrei Lankov - Why part of me will miss Trump s ignorant and eccentric approach to North Korea This is an article published today that was written by Andrei Lankov, one of my favorite North Korea experts. Trump's North Korea deal was unrealistic, but at least it had a chance. Biden's North Korea policy will play it safe. Most of my American friends are happy these days they believe that U.S. President Donald Trump s impending exit from the White House is good news for the country and the world at large. They might be right, but I have mixed feelings about the premature end of Trump s reign. It may indeed be good news for the majority of Americans and perhaps even the majority of the earthlings. But it s not necessarily good news for the people I care about the most the inhabitants of the Korean Peninsula. Just to make things clear, I did not like Trump and his administration. The man was narcissistic, unpredictable, sometimes comically ignorant and pompous. However, when it comes to Korean affairs, things are not that simple. Perhaps Trump s very ignorance and eccentricity is what made it possible for him to consider something otherwise inconsiderable to a more conventional and balanced politician, such as President-elect Joe Biden. After all, Trump was unusual in his apparent willingness to seriously consider a compromise with the North Korean regime. At the Hanoi summit of 2019, he attempted a compromise, though it was ultimately unachieved. The North Korean side asked for too much, and it was willing to give too little. However, the deal discussed in Hanoi still had a chance of working, so long as a few modifications were made. Under such a deal, North Korea would destroy a significant part of its nuclear research and development and manufacturing facilities in exchange for the lifting of U.N. sanctions. North Korea would also possibly receive some kind of official recognition as a de-facto nuclear state. But now, we are entering a new era given the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential elections an era of far more conventional politics. President-elect Biden is not particularly interested in Korea, but he is still likely to continue America s old, pre-Trumpian ways. For example, Biden may revive former President Barack Obama s strategic patience policy under some new, fancy name. It would sell well with the U.S. public, U.S. Congress and U.S. media for a while, at least. However, this policy has one minor shortcoming It is not going to stop the slow-motion deterioration of the Korean Peninsula s situation. It s also clear that the Biden administration will emphasize sanctions. Nevertheless, the military hardware rolled out at North Korea s Oct. 10 parade emphasized once again that sanctions are not going to stop the country s ICBM and nuclear programs. At best, sanctions can slow these programs down. Until recently, it was possible to think that sanctions might undermine the North Korean economy, thus pushing North Korea towards a revolution. But since then, the situation has changed Now, there is a Cold War 2.0 between the U.S. and China, and Beijing is more interested in keeping the status quo in Northeast Asia than ever before. Simply put, China will definitely save North Korea from any kind of serious crisis. So, a prolonged economic crisis is possible, but a revolution is not. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made it quite clear that he will attract attention to the human rights issue in North Korea. No doubt, these human rights abuses are hellish. Nevertheless, this issue is not going to be changed by lofty talk emanating from the Western capitals, nor by sharp-worded resolutions from the U.N. and other assorted international agencies. Once the North Koreans lose hope for some sort of deal, they will have fewer reasons to behave carefully like they did during the turbulent years of President Trump. All of this means that we are probably going to see ICBMs flying over the Pacific in the near future, or perhaps even early next year unless, of course, the Chinese intervene and prevent the North Koreans, who are now more dependent on Beijing than ever, from doing something excessively provocative. Now, the North Korean hereditary elite is sitting on a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, and so the prospects of a possible domestic crisis in that country are more terrifying than, say, 15 years ago. North Korea s newly acquired Chinese sponsorship dramatically decreases the chances of any successful regime change. The North Korean regime has also recently undertaken measures that significantly increased its ability to control the population, thus making any chances for a domestic upheaval even thinner. So, under Joe Biden, we will more likely see Americans turning their backs on Pyongyang. Sanctions will continue, and partly because sanctions are an easy sell domestically. They look tough to the uninitiated and can be presented as a sign that the administration is doing something while nothing meaningful is really being done. Lofty talks about human rights and great moral principles will provide the policy with additional packaging. But essentially, nothing substantial will be done, and we shouldn t expect that the Biden administration will do anything dramatic to increase the chances of a regime change, either. Meanwhile, the DPRK s HEU-producing centrifuges will work around the clock, and the North Korean engineers admittedly smart and creative will work around the clock, too, developing better and better ICBMs. Their goal is to develop an ICBM that can be launched within minutes and can penetrate the American anti-missile defense system. They re likely to achieve this goal, and perhaps sometime soon. In other words, I would not be surprised if we witness the first North Korean solid-fuel ICBM launched over the Pacific by the end of Joe Biden s first term. If and when this happens, we might see some moves. But so far, things will likely go the way they have been going for the last 30 years that is, from bad to worse. Frankly, I don t know if Donald Trump could have stopped it. But at least, under his watch, we would have a real but low chance of a negotiated deal. Of course, this deal would never bring about denuclearization that s never going to happen. As I have been saying for at least a decade now, the U.S. government and broader international community must stop being oblivious and must abandon its dream of denuclearizing North Korea. The opportunities for complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization are long gone. Instead, arms control is the best that we can hope for. But the later these compromises are made, the worse things are going to get. So far, Joe Biden s election appears to mean that we will lose another four or eight years of precious time. This is not good news. But still, I congratulate my American friends, anyway. If I were in their shoes, I would be in a good mood, too.

Title: Why was the Korean government so hard on its citizens between the Korean War and when everything began to loosen in the 80’s?
Content: Why was the Korean government so hard on its citizens between the Korean War and when everything began to loosen in the 80 s? For starters, my knowledge on Korean history is incomplete, so if I m wrong on anything, please correct me. So, having been relieved of Japanese occupation after WW2, Korea was relieved of one problem, but was then faced with another issues with the North . After the Korean War when everything got officially divided sadly , why did the Korean government maintain an overbearing and systemic control over the free South Korean populace? Curfews, image control, media and entertainment control, and the likes. Sure, there have been many instances where various governments have implemented a degree of what many may understandably deem unnecessary control over its people, but to me, South Korea seems a tad unique in its historical plight in that, while seemingly free, there were many bans and restrictions on what people could and couldn t do. I m aware of Gwangju rising and I m watching a movie set before then Go Go 70 s and both of these times in Korea symbolize a stronghold of the government on its people. Yes, many Koreans want the peninsula to be unified, but why on earth would a free government suppress its people to the degree that the South Korean government did to its people when it did?

Title: How to Free North Korea
Content: How to Free North Korea For a decade, from 1998 to 2007, South Korea pursued a policy of engagement towards North Korea known as the Sunshine Policy. Initiated by the late South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and further developed by his successor the late President Roh Moo Hyun, the approach was an embrace of North Korea s regime, with unconditional aid, direct talks, and rewards in hopes of promoting a softening of the North and political conciliation. As part of this strategy, in practice effectively one of all carrots and no sticks, the South Korean government clamped down on any efforts that might cause offense to Pyongyang, particularly exposure of its abhorrent, unparalleled human rights violations. From 2004 to 2008, when I served as co-founder and Executive Director of an organization called Liberty in North Korea, we worked to raise awareness of North Korea s human rights violations and encourage other countries to help improve conditions inside. Throughout Asia, our team members ran underground shelters helping North Koreans escape, and some of the activists including myself, in 2006 were imprisoned in China for their efforts. During that time, many North Korean defectors complained regularly about how the South Korean government muzzled their efforts to shed light on their experiences in the North stories of hunger, torture, public executions, criminal acts by the regime, and concentration camps. Prominent defectors were barred from leaving South Korea to testify in the United States or Europe, even on invitation of the United States Congress, and many spoke of being blocked by the South s National Intelligence Service from organizing, managing newsletters and meeting with foreign media or diplomats stationed in Seoul. South Korean press and the film industry began portraying North Korea more favorably. In our occasional run-ins with South Korean officials or thinly-masked intelligence agents, some made allusions to the risk we might face if we continued our work. Around the world, businessmen and community leaders of Korean heritage told us of heavy pressure from their local Korean consulates to not support the cause of human rights in North Korea, and certainly not contribute financially to the effort. At the time, with no small amount of irony, we faced more opposition and impediment from the government of South Korea than we did from that of the North. At the time, we faced more opposition and impediment from the government of South Korea than we did from that of the North. It was a dark and bewildering time when a democracy forged in blood defended and empowered the most despicable of oppressive regimes. How did North Korea react to the South s appeasement Sunshine Policy? During this same time, it clashed with the South Korean Navy June 15, 1999 and sunk a patrol boat, killing 6 and wounding 18 South Korean Navy men June 28, 2002 . It conducted rocket tests August 1998 , a nuclear test October 9, 2006 , and a handful of missile tests February 2003, March 2003, July 2006 , and actively helped proliferate weapons systems, technology and materials to Yemen, Iran and Libya, among other countries. President Kim Dae Jung won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to improve relations with the North, which culminated in a historic June 2000 meeting with the then-leader Kim Jong Il. The summit was later found to have been bought with an estimated 500 million dollars in illegal, secret transfers of cash, a greater amount than North Korea s annual export earnings at the time. One can imagine what North Korea spent that cash on. With the election of conservative President Lee Myung Bak in 2007, it seemed the days of such madness were finally behind us. Letting North Korea win now will only strengthen it further. North Korea should not be allowed to continue bending the world to its whim with blackmail and extortion. It must learn that the civilized world does not work this way.

Content: Kimchi Feud- international standard for Kimchi was agreed in 2001 between South Korea UN Recent controversy between Korea and China mentioned in the article 1 BTS leader RM's Van Fleet Award ceremony speech The speech angered Chinese Netizens b c RM did not mention that Chinese lives were sacrificed during Korean War. For those who don't know, China fought against South Korea and UN during Korean war. China sided with North Korea . For example, should the US thank Germany and Japan for their sacrifices during WWII according to C-netizens...? 2 Hanbok vs. Hanfu. Recently historical Chinese dramas have been dressing actors in outfits similar to Korean Hanbok. Chinese Hanfu has been traditionally different looking from Hanbok other than court official outfits . Especially, maids were dressed in Hanbok, which angered K-netizens. Vietnam recently had similar controversy with Ao Dai and started aodaibelongstovietnam movement. 3 Kimchi controversy Lately, C-netizens have been trolling and arguing that since there are many Korean Chinese people living in China, Korean culture is also Chinese culture because these people are considered ethnic minority. Many Chinese TV shows have been showcasing Hanbok, Kimchi, Arirang famous Korean folk song as "Chinese culture". This is based on the argument that after absorbing Korea's ancient kingdom Goguryeo Koguryo , the Korean culture and history belong to China, too. So according to this Chinese logic, perhaps the US should argue that entire Latin culture is American now since there are so many Latino Americans living in the US. Especially, a part of Mexico Texas now is a US state, so is Mexican culture American now? Or should we argue that Chinese culture is everyone's b c we all have Chinatowns somewhere in the world and Chinese people are ethnic minority in every country.

Title: Sharp decrease in racism in South Korea according to 2017-2020 World Values Survey report
Content: Sharp decrease in racism in South Korea according to 2017-2020 World Values Survey report In the 2017-2020 World Values Survey report, of 1245 Koreans surveyed, 15.2 responded that they would not want someone of a different race as a neighbor. This represents a sharp decrease from the 2010-2014 WVS report, where of 1200 South Koreans surveyed, 34.1 responded that they would not want someone of a different race as a neighbor. This follows a general trend of decreased racism in most all countries surveyed by the WVS. From 2010-2014 to 2017-2020, the percentage of Americans stating that they would not want someone of a different race as a neighbor dropped from 5.6 to 3.0 . The percentage of Germans stating this dropped from 14.8 to 2.7 . The percentage of Japanese stating this dropped from 22.3 to 14.3 the percentage of Russians, from 17.2 to 15.7 , and the percentage Australians, from 5.0 to 3.9 . This information can be found on page 68 of the 2010-2014 WVS Wave 6 report and on page 122 of the 2017-2020 WVS Wave 7 report.

Title: Gay (foreigner) life in South Korea?
Content: Gay foreigner life in South Korea? 여러분 안녕하세요 I have the opportunity to either study in Taiwan or South Korea for my master's degree. I am comfortable with both cultures language-wise I'm more comfortable with Chinese because of my family but I grew up with tons of Korean media and friends so no real issues with learning more of the language . Anywho, I have been an out and proud homo for about 6 years now. All of my family knows and approves, all of my friends know and approve, all of my coworkers and colleagues know and approve, etc. I've been super lucky and super blessed to have so much support! I've been to Taiwan before, so I know at least if I study there then there is no real expectation for me to go back in the closet, but I'm not so sure if that would be true if I decided to choose S.Korea. I know S.Korea is a very religious country and many older Koreans are not friendly to gays. I'm wondering if anyone could share their experience on being gay as a foreigner preferably in South Korea? Would i be expected to go back into the closet essentially? Will I be spared criticism because of my foreigner status? How is dating life? Are there other gays that are publicly out? Etc. I'm just looking for relatable experiences to help me make my decision 정말 감사합니다 Edit Thank you so much for all the responses! I really appreciate everyone's input! I do have more questions so I'll try to start responding soon

Content: South Korea Coronavirus VACCINE Speculation Thread NEWS PREDICTIONS GENERAL DISCUSSION What's up Korean reddit community. This is actually my first post so bare with me...BUT I have been reading a bunch of different threads on the current situation in Korea, but little vaccine speculations timeline, first come first serve, various questions and such , so I just wanted to organize a space for general discussion, thoughts and news regard all things with the KOREA vaccine update. some starter questions 1. What are your own personal timeline predictions for a vaccine in Korea? 2. How do you think the government is going to handle the rollout of the vaccine how long do you think it would take with the systems in place to administer the appropriate amount? 3. What is your opinion on maybe being able to travel at the latter end of the year Fall, Winter with a vaccine of course. Still needing a 14-day Quarantine? Vaccine card? 4. How do you predict the end of the summer early fall to look if a vaccine is successful and a majority of people are covered cases death s drop significantly? Mandates lifted? Social distance Mask wearing I hope everyone stays safe and sane through these times, and remember were all going through the same shit so I would appreciate if we kept the political criticisms to a bare minimum, and just focused on the potential future.

Title: Open an Importation Business in South Korea
Content: Open an Importation Business in South Korea Hi there, As you see in the title, I am thinking about importing some goods from my country in Europe to S. Korea. More specifically, I want to import some cooking items like oils and vinegar to the country. My partner and I want to start the business and our relative in Korea would take the goods and carry out the distribution. However, it looks like the process is more complicated that just registering as a freelancer in my country and send everything there apart from all the papers that you have to sign prior to the shipment . Anyway, the thing is that we really want to open this business but the information on the internet is pretty confusing. Have any of you started a business like this in Korea or have any info about it? Thanks!

Title: Expats in North Korea?
Content: Expats in North Korea? I was wondering if these days there are still expats in the DPRK? I know there used to be, although very low in numbers. I talked on the internet to two former expats in the DPRK, one was a foreign investor and the other one worked for an NGO providing aid. They apparently lived in an expat compound in the outskirts of Pyongyang, although were allowed to go to places in the country usually off-limits for foreigners due to having to be there for their work. If you distribute food for an NGO, you obviously have to go to the countryside too. They had international media and internet access. I'm not sure if there is currently an expat community, even if just a small one, in the country. In case there would be do expats still have to live in a compound or can they live in an apartment in Pyongyang amongst the locals? When socialising or interacting with the locals, I assume as an expat you have to play the regime's game and not express any dissident opinions or talk about the rest of the world out there? assuming that they socialise with locals at all other than for professional reasons

On one hand I feel like the new nation would be under immense pressure to immediately disarm themselves of nuclear weapons. On the other hand I could see a reunified Korea viewing their nuclear weapons as a great tool for national and regional security and as long as they align with the US I think it is feasible they could keep their arsenal without much resistance from the west.

Title: How are American Korean war Veterans thought of or treated in Korea
Content: How are American Korean war Veterans thought of or treated in Korea Hello, x200B My uncle recently passed. Before his death I was talking to him about the Korean War. In the USA, there really wasn't even a major monument to the people who died in the Korean War until 1995, and it was a bit of a forgotten war. I know he experienced some horrible things in the war, but I don't know if he ever got to see what South Korea grew into after the war. I feel that, if you look between the lives of North and South Koreans, it is an example of a war that was worth sacrificing for in order to give a decent life to many South Koreans. I am wondering if anyone know how US Military Veterans of the Korean War are thought of and treated in South Korea.

WW2 and to a lesser extent the War in Afghanistan are viewed as worthwile causes, while Vietnam and Iraq have the negative image of a power hungry government not caring about its own or other people. But what about the Korean War? Do people think it was also for a good cause, or do they also have a cynical view of it, both now and then? For example were veterans given a heros welcome or were they viewed as murderers and losers?

Apparently Korean law says by default the estate goes to the kids. My mom is still alive and well and will be needing this money. Does anyone know what we can do? Usually the funeral home sends all the info to ssn etc but he passed away in another country and we are stumped. Thank you in advance for any advice!

Title: [Question] Does North Korea want an internationally famous hero?
Content: Question Does North Korea want an internationally famous hero? In the 1975 film Rollerball, James Caan's character becomes incredibly famous, loved, respected, and idolized. The corporate leaders believe this makes him too powerful, his words even more powerful that their own, and demand that he retire from the game. Would such a scenario play out in North Korea if it was to have a truly internationally famous hero along the lines of a Neil Armstrong, Edmund Hillary, Stephen Hawking, Leonardo Da Vinci, Elvis Presley, Albert Einstein. In the unlikely event that a North Korean was to discover a cure for cancer or invent a technology that fixed global warming, would they ever risk the possibility that this internationally known hero become more well respected and popular that the glorious leader himself? Would it be preferable to the regime if the hero was to tragically die in an earthquake or flood, or other natural disaster?

Title: How does a rising China influence the relations between South Korea and Japan?
Content: How does a rising China influence the relations between South Korea and Japan? South Korea and Japan have had a complicated relationship. We all know about the comfort women issue. South Korea does not feel as though Japan has formally apologized for the atrocities they committed during the time they occupied the Korean Peninsula. There is also the issue of the Dokdo. Territorial disputes are a major source of tension between the two. They have had some trade issues as well such as in 2013, South Korea banned seafood products from Japan due to the Fukushima incident. Some triumphs between the two would be when they co hosted FIFA in 1996. This was successful. As well as cultural exchanges and characteristics that they do share. However, it is a rocky road for South Korea and Japan still. With China as a rising superpower, Japan does feel it would benefit them to get closer to South Korea. How do you see Chinas rise influencing the relations between South Korea and Japan? Could it bring them closer?

Title: Exploring South Korea’s Relations With Southeast Asia
Content: Exploring South Korea s Relations With Southeast Asia While South Korea's economic ties with Southeast Asia aren't as large as China or Japan, its economic involvement and people to people ties with the region are proportionally much greater than its two larger neighbors. Southeast Asia is more important to South Korea than it is for China and Japan. This post will be organized as follows 1. HISTORY 2. ECONOMIC TIES 3. PEOPLE TO PEOPLE EXCHANGES 4. MILITARY AND SECURITY TIES 5. NEW SOUTHERN POLICY 6. INTEGRATION OF US INDO PACIFIC POLICY AND THE NEW SOUTHERN POLICY Parts 1-4 will list the facts of South Korea's engagement in Southeast Asia because very few people here know about South Korea's extensive presence in the region. Once you understand this, you will comprehend the reasoning behind South Korea's New Southern Policy of 2017, why its decision to build an aircraft carrier isn't absurd. Like Japan, South Korea has to shield itself against China-North Korea in Northeast Asia, while thrusting southward to "join forces" with the US in the Indo Pacific. HISTORY The first "official" exchanges between Korea and Southeast Asia took place in 1391 when Nai Gong, an envoy of the Siamese king, arrived at the capital of Koryo Dynasty 918 1392 in a mission to sound out the Korean market and to confirm the possibility of bilateral trade. However, we don't know whether it was a Chinese merchant based in the court of Siam pretending to be official envoys or an actual official diplomatic mission. Much of what Korean officials knew about Southeast Asia was through Chinese and starting from the 17th century, Japanese official sources. Secondly, they had unofficial contacts with Southeast Asian envoys, particularly Vietnamese, during their tributary missions in China. However, starting from the mid-19th century Koreans begin to have more direct knowledge of the region, unfiltered by her two larger neighbors. For most Southeast Asians the first widely known contact with Koreans were those who served in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War. After the Second World war, Koreans presence was felt through their involvement in the Vietnam War. The first involvement of South Korean business in Southeast Asia was as contractors to the US military during the Vietnam War. Roughly 320,000 South Koreans served in the Vietnam War, the second-largest foreign contingent after the United States. On the other side, North Korea sent two fighter squadrons and an anti-aircraft regiment. The first involvement of South Korean business in Southeast Asia was as contractors to the US military during the Vietnam War, most notably Hyundai. These contractors also involved themselves non-military US Western funded projects. South Korean President Lee Myung Bak was a manager for Hyundai Construction on the Pattani Narathiwat Highway in the late 1960s. NOTE Here is a journal article The chaebol and the US military industrial complex Cold War geopolitical economy and South Korean industrialization that explains the Offshore Procurement Contracts OPC obtained by South Korean firms, were significant contributors to South Korean industrialization. From 1967-70, these OPC along with Us military assistance made up to 40-60 of South Korea's Gross Capital Formation. In the late 1970s, overseas construction contracts were equal to 9-11 of South Korea's GDP. . One could argue, South Korea was the real victor in the Vietnam War. ECONOMIC TIES Here is a summary of South Korea economic ties in Southeast Asia South Korea has an FTA with ASEAN, and an individual FTA with Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. ASEAN is South Korea's second-largest export market after China. US 95 Billion vs 142 Billion China of South Korea's exports as of 2017. It will most likely become South Korea's top export market in a decade, as South Korean companies continue to shift production from China to ASEAN. South Korea is ASEAN's 5th largest trading partner South Korea's investment in ASEAN has exceeded her investments in China over the last 7 years. In 2018, Vietnam got twice as much FDI from South Korea compared to China. South Korea is the fifth largest investor in ASEAN after EU, Japan, China, US. SOUTH KOREA INVESTMENT IN ASEAN In terms of FDI, here are the figures for East Asian countries in ASEAN for 2018. East Asian companies invest in Southeast Asia because of proximity. cheap labor and young labor force. Its median age is 29.1 vs 38 years for China and its average per capita income is US 4890, half that of China. The income level is like China in 2010, its median age is the same as China in 2000, the fertility rate is like China's in 1992. x200B Country Amount Billion p22 Share - - - Japan 21 14 China 10 7 Hong Kong 10 7 South Korea 7 4 Taiwan 3.5 x200B In 2020, 80 of ASEAN's FDI went to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore. This is a rough estimate since many companies use offshore entities to invest. For example, 28 of Taiwan's outbound investment went to offshore havens. A lot of investment that goes to Singapore gets invested elsewhere in ASEAN. South Korean companies started to seriously shift production from China to ASEAN in 2017 after the THAAD incident. South Korean FDI to ASEAN countries totaled US 9.55 billion, compared to the US 5.8 billion in FDI to China. Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia accounted for 88.6 of South Korean FDI in the ASEAN region last year, indicating an intensifying concentration of investment in those countries compared with the 50.1 recorded in 2010 About 73 of South Korea's small to medium firms investment in ASEAN is manufacturing. Vietnam takes up 2 3 of their ASEAN investment, followed by Indonesia and Singapore p162 . x200B Besides export-focused manufacturing in Vietnam, South Korea has made significant investments in the Indonesian car industry and Philippines shipbuilding. South Korean companies intend to pour billions into Indonesia's auto and EV battery sector. At the present moment, the ASEAN car industry is dominated by Japanese companies, and South Korean companies have very little presence. LARGE, GROWING AND PROFITABLE CONSUMER MARKET Many South Korean companies see Southeast Asia as a large consumer market. For K-pop groups, it is their key foreign market after they were "banned" in China in 2017. It is even more so for Lotte, the company at the center of the THAAD fiasco. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam make up 58 of Lotte's overseas revenue Malaysia was the top contributor with 30.3 percent of the total, followed by Indonesia with 13.3 percent and the United States with 9 percent. China ranked fourth with a 7.9 percent share, down one spot from the previous year. The world s second-largest economy was the leading source of Lotte s overseas revenue with 25 percent in 2016. The CJ Group owns the largest Cinema chain in Vietnam and Myanmar, and the second-largest in Indonesia PEOPLE TO PEOPLE EXCHANGES South Korea is the third-largest source of tourist for ASEAN after China and the EU. ASEAN is the top tourism destination for South Koreans Roughly 650,000 South Koreans are residing in Southeast Asia, with the bulk of them living in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia Of the 868,000 foreign workers in South Korea about 30 come from Southeast Asia p214 . In South Korea, Southeast Asians make up 1 3 of the international students vs 44 for China The flow also occurs in the opposite direction, the Philippines has become an English camp for South Korean students. with 30,000 studying short-term courses in the Philippines every year. In South Korea, out of 242,538 marriages in 2017, 5.4 were between South Korean and foreign women. Out of that, 40 were Southeast Asian women, with Vietnamese women making up 75 of the total. MILITARY AND SECURITY TIES In the section, I will focus on South Korea's military engagement with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The first two due to their extensive South Korean arms purchases, and Vietnam due to the potential for much greater defense cooperation. South Korea's most extensive military ties in Southeast Asia are with Indonesia. In 2006, South Korea and Indonesia signed a strategic partnership agreement. The cooperation with Indonesia ranges from arms sales to technology transfers and defense industrial cooperation KF-X Fighter . The scale and diversity of South Korean arms exports to Indonesia ranging from small arms, infantry fighting vehicles, and self-propelled artillery to fighter jets and submarines represents the most consequential aspect of its push to broaden its defense partnerships in the Indo-Pacific The Philippines and South Korean military ties date back to the Korean War, when the Philippines sent 7420 troops to South Korea, the 4th largest contingent. In October 2013, the two sides signed an agreement deepening defense cooperation, including promoting defense industrial cooperation and military exchanges. The Philippines is the second-largest arms buyer in Southeast Asia for South Korea after Indonesia. South Korean ties with Vietnam, both political and military, have been hampered by its role in the Vietnam War. However this difficult history recently being reexamined for evidence of long-forgotten massacres of Vietnamese civilians and the sexual exploitation and rape of Vietnamese women has not stopped ever-closer economic and personal ties between the two countries. But closer defense ties have been hindered by 1. The United States' Arms Embargo was lifted in 2016 2. South Korean outreach to Vietnam has elicited cooperation against North Korea, but Vietnam's price is most likely its cooperation against China on the SCS. 3. Worries about leaking of technical specifications on defense equipment to North Korea 4. Most policymakers still emphasize North Korea and Chinese Japanese threats South Korea is the third-largest arms supplier in the region after the US and Russia for 2014-2018, and the region is its biggest export market p14 Here is a list of South Korea's major weapons exports to the region Philippines. 2 Frigates, 1 Corvette donated , 2 Amphibious transport dock,12 KAI T-50 Fighters, 18 K136 Rocket Launcher Thailand - 1 Frigate, 8 KAI T-50 Trainer Indonesia - 3 Submarines, 2 Amphibious transport dock, 2 Landing Docks, 1 Hospital Ship 3 Missile Boats, 14 KAI T-50 Light Attack Trainer, 22 Armored Fighting Vehicle, 54 155mm Artillery, 54 105 mm Artillery Malaysia - 2 Training Ships, 2 Offshore Patrol Vessels, 111 Armored Fighter Vehicle Vietnam - 2 Corvettes donated Myanmar - 100 155mm Artillery, 1 Amphibious transport dock Many South Korean arms contract involve technology transfers There are two motives for the arms sales. First to spread the cost of maintaining its defense-industrial complex. The second is to offer Southeast Asians an alternative to China. South Korean strategy has been to aid the rebalance without explicitly antagonizing China Korean security cooperation with ASEAN members appears to be fueled by a perceived desire to expand the ROK s diplomatic influence beyond the peninsula, reduce dependency on the United States and China, make contributions to reinforcing the liberal rules-based international order, play a middle power role, and find markets for the country s defense products to sustain the South Korean defense industry, NEW SOUTHERN POLICY In 2017, President Moon Jae-in launched the New Southern Policy NSP , which aimed to elevate the country's ties with Southeast Asia and India to those with China, Japan, United States, and Russia. My view on this is given its extensive ties that had existed before 2018, second only to its ties to China, a belated admission by the South Korean government of the region's importance, One must note all the Northeast Asian states, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have a Go South policy, whether implicit or explicit. There are three goals to the NSP People Community - People to People exchanges like Tourism Prosperity Community - US 200 Billion Worth of Trade Peace Community is to construct a peaceful and safe environment in the region. Cooperation on terrorism, cyber and maritime security What sets the New Southern Policy apart from other previous engagements with ASEAN is, in addition to economic aspects, it includes a diplomatic and military component. NSP was to provide, as argued by Choe Wongi, Head of Center for ASEAN India Studies at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy KNDA in The NSP represents Seoul s middle power ambition in search of greater strategic autonomy by taking on greater international responsibilities and roles that are deemed commensurate with its status and capabilities in a global society INTEGRATION OF US INDO PACIFIC POLICY AND THE NEW SOUTHERN POLICY The peace component of the NSO has been large. However, in January 2021, the US and South Korea announced the i ntegration of the Indo-Pacific Policy and NSP at the margins of the East Asia Summit Our cooperation is comprehensive and growing.

Title: Question about South korea
Content: Question about South korea First of all let me just say that my knowledge of the Korea peninsula is small at best so this may sound horribly ignorant so I apologize in advance. Do South Koreans want to unify with the north by this point? Or is it more symbolic than anything really? Like let s say if North Korea is now part of the south I don t know how but they do , the south would have to spend an ungodly amount of money to make it modernized or atleast up to standard.they would have 25 million people who will experience the biggest culture shock in modern history and would lead to mass emigration from the north to the better off south. For example Germany was split for less and still have problems with the east to this day.Also what do you do with the massive military now gone? Rehabilitate the soldiers? What about the nuclear weapons?What about the generals and those who had power in the north? Also would South Koreans want a border with China? I guess what I m trying to say is do South Koreans actually want unification?

I understand that this group is meant to be one of westernized nations, but South Korea fits that bill. They re also one of the wealthiest countries in the world and have enough global power to have standing within that crowd. Does their slight rivalry with Japan have anything to do with their absence? Also, what would it take for members to permit Russia to rejoin G-8? Would the United States prefer to take a Nixon-style approach to China s rise and befriend Russia?

Title: In 2000, Kim Jong-il reportedly proposed/agreed to maintenance of US forces on the Korean Peninsula after unification
Content: In 2000, Kim Jong-il reportedly proposed agreed to maintenance of US forces on the Korean Peninsula after unification 김대중 대통령께 비밀 사항을 정식으로 말씀드리겠습니다. 미군 주둔 문제입니다만, 1992년 초 미국 공화당 정부 시기에 김용순 비서를 미국에 특사로 보내 북과 남이 싸움 안 하기로 했다 고 말했습니다. 그러면서 미군이 계속 남아서 남과 북이 전쟁을 하지 않도록 막아주는 역할을 해달라 고 요청했댔습니다. 역사적으로 주변 강국들이 한반도의 지정학적 위치와 전략적 가치를 탐내어 수많은 침략을 자행한 사례를 들면서 동아시아의 역학관계로 보아 반도의 평화를 유지하자면 미군이 와 있는 것이 좋다 고 말해줬어요. 제가 알기로 김 대통령께서는 통일이 돼도 미군이 있어야 한다 고 말씀하셨는데, 그건 제 생각과도 일치합니다. 미군이 남조선에 주둔하는 것이 남조선 정부로서는 여러 가지로 부담이 많겠으나 결국 극복해야 할 문제가 아니겠습니까? "I would like to formally speak to the President Kim Dae-Jung about confidential matters. It's about the US military presence - in early 1992, during the US's Republican government, North Korea sent secretary Kim Yong-sun 김용순 as an emissary to convey that 'the North and South Koreas have decided to cease conflict'. In doing so, he requested that 'the US forces remain in order to play the role of preventing the South and North from engaging in military conflict'. Using historical precedents of neighbouring powers frequently invading the Korean Peninsula for its geopolitical position and strategic value, we explained to the US that 'considering the dynamics of East Asia, in order to maintain peace on the peninsula, it is beneficial for the US military to be present'. To my knowledge, President Kim stated that 'the US forces must be present even after unification', and this is in accordance with my own opinions. There must be various burdens on the part of the South Korean government for the US forces to be stationed in South Korea, but isn't this an issue that must be overcome?" shitty translation by me Kim Jong-il is reported to have said this on June 13, 2000, during the summit between him and Kim Dae-jung. Lim Dong-won, the South Korean Minister of Unification at the time, was also present. First time I've heard of anything like this - I was under the impression that NK's position on US forces has always and consistently been GTFO, so I thought it was pretty interesting.

Of the 700 total students, 482 were Korean-born, 189 were born in Japan proper, 6 were born in Taiwan, 4 were born in Kwantung Leased Territory, 12 were born in Manchukuo, 6 were born in China, and 1 was born in Russia. Only 232 have ever visited Japan proper, and 468 have never visited Japan proper. In other words, it's been found that two thirds of the student body have never seen Japan proper, which suggests that it will be very difficult to cultivate a national conviction in the student body. Thus, the school decided to try to secure the national conviction of the students of Pyongyang Girls' High School by giving them opportunities henceforth. my transcription in modern Japanese orthography 昭和十年十一月四日 京城日報 朝鮮子絶対多数 平壌高女の調査に異常数字 国家観念確把に支障ありと 当局では問題重視 平壌 平壌高等女学校では今回全校生徒七百名に対し出生地別と満六歳以後における内地体験の有無を調査したところ 出生地は朝鮮生れ四八二 内地一八九 台湾六 関東州四 満州国一二 支那六 ロシア一という数字を見せこの中内地を体験したもの僅かに二三二 体験のない者四六八という全校の三分二は内地の風物に接しないということが判明し国家的信念培養に非常に困難を感じている状態である これがため同校では今後平壌高女独自の立場から機会あることに信念確把に努めることにした Link to full newspaper issue 京城日報 1935-11-04 京城日報社 Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming Internet Archive

Title: Another part of a propaganda interview of Korean comfort women who just returned from a whirlwind 1943 Japan tour visiting wounded Imperial Japanese soldiers, and one of the comfort women retired to "live life without shame as a sister and mother of splendid soldiers of the Korean peninsula"
Content: Another part of a propaganda interview of Korean comfort women who just returned from a whirlwind 1943 Japan tour visiting wounded Imperial Japanese soldiers, and one of the comfort women retired to "live life without shame as a sister and mother of splendid soldiers of the Korean peninsula" This is my translation and transcription of two news articles from Keijo Nippo, a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of Japan-colonized Korea. These have never been republished or translated before, to the best of my knowledge. The following articles are about a "performing arts comfort team" of 14 Korean comfort women, or kisaeng, who went to Japan in July and August 1943 to sing, dance, and "comfort" wounded Imperial Japanese soldiers in Japan. Kisaeng were Korean female entertainers who sang, danced, played musical instruments and wrote poems to entertain upper-class men. In earlier times, their work did not necessarily always involve sexual service, but during Japanese colonial rule of Korea, they were more closely associated with sex work. By the 1940s, the vast majority were involved in prostitution. I previously posted three other posts on this subreddit about this comfort team under these titles 1. Korean comfort women in a "performing arts comfort team" embarked on whirlwind July-August 1943 Japan tour visiting wounded Imperial Japanese soldiers 2. Korean comfort women interviewed after whirlwind 1943 Japan tour visiting wounded Imperial Japanese soldiers who 'showed us again and again with their bodies, not with their words, that Japan and Korea were to be unified as one' and 'we were often moved to tears because we did not feel worthy' 3. 1943 editorial calls for Korean language to be wiped out, says Korean comfort women were touched by the noble appearance and hearts of the Imperial Japanese soldiers, and the women offered heartfelt comfort in response as their chests filled with excitement, their sincere hearts touching each other The August 14th article precedes the August 15th article which I translated earlier under the second previous post. The August 14th article seems like it continues from a previous article, which I have not been able to find so far. Start of translation Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo August 14, 1943 A chorus of sincerity in response to gratitude Receiving encouragement from the heroes in white Performing arts comfort team Roundtable discussion and report following their return x200B The Korean comfort women singing the Patriotic March song at the Kokura Army Hospital in Kyushu, Japan. Keijo Nippo reporter It seems that you went to Tokyo after that. What was your impression of wartime Tokyo? Gil Song-ja 길송자 吉松子 I was amazed at how well Tokyo regulated its city illumination. On the night we arrived, being country bumpkins, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into, and it was so dark that we wouldn't have known if our noses were being pinched. The seriousness of the air-raid drills touched our hearts so much that it made us ashamed of what we were doing. All the girls wore Monpe work pants, which were very different from those worn in Korea and more suitable for practical use. We really felt that we needed to wear them too. They were not the thin, flimsy Monpe work pants that we wear here in Korea, but they were made of simple cut fabric, and we really felt that our work pants had to be like that. Park Sun-sil 박순실 朴淳實 We were overcome by the greatness of Japan proper and the mental strength of the people of Japan proper, as we were directly confronted by the natural scenery as well as by the men and women who lived there, who were far better people than we were. In Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyushu, we were treated like true sisters. Even the upper-class ladies were full of kindness through their humble words and mannerisms. We felt a beauty that we could never see on the Korean peninsula, and we learned about the strength of the children who grew up there. On the one hand, they are kind, but on the other hand, they are also very strong. We were deeply moved by the training activities of the women's associations and secondary school students, and we were deeply convinced that Japan had to be a strong country if they could do this so well. We strongly felt that Korean women should definitely learn from them. Keijo Nippo reporter You must have been deeply moved when you went to many hospitals for comfort visits. Kim Wol 김월 金月 At every hospital, we would go around to greet seriously injured patients before the performances start. When we finished our greetings at the First Army Hospital, a soldier came to us and encouraged us saying, "I hear that conscription has finally been established on the Korean peninsula. Congratulations! We are relieved to hear that. Please do your best. We're counting on you, we're counting on you..." At that time, we became firmly determined to completely live out our lives strongly as military women. Kim Jeon-wang 김전왕 金田旺 I believe it was at the Second Army Hospital that the Yomiuri newspaper photography team visited us. As usual, we were visiting patients in the hospital wards, and when we saw one of the patients smiling at us despite the pain of his serious injuries, we were all moved to tears and encouraged by his smile. A patient who could not get up said, "I'm fine, I'm fine," as he turned his head and waved his hand still lying on his back. We met Mr. Oyama, who was a Korean volunteer soldier, and we were all sincerely happy to see that he was in such good spirits, not at all different from the soldiers of Japan proper. When we greeted Mr. Oyama saying, "we will serve our nation rising up 25 million strong in the Korean peninsula", Mr. Oyama's voice and body trembled as he responded with just one phrase, "I'm counting on you". Yoo San-hong 유산홍 劉山紅 I think that happened at a hospital in Hiroshima. I remember a soldier wearing white who surprised me by suddenly calling out to me, "Sister...." He said to me with the same friendliness that one would show to one's siblings, "Even after you return to Korea, please do your utmost best for the nation. If I go back to the war zone, I will surely tell stories about your heartfelt comfort to my war comrades," whereupon I bowed my head. Kim Geum-hong 김금홍 金錦紅 At the Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo, there was an isolation room where patients were not allowed to receive comfort during normal hours. The regulations did not allow it, but we were hoping that we could do it here as well for these patients. We asked them if we could give these people comfort visits. When we went to the hospital rooms, we found that all the windows in the hallways had been opened, and there were people lying on bed chairs and in wicker chairs looking out of the windows, and many nurses were lined up behind them. It was a hot day in the courtyard, but we were about to leave after singing the Arirang chorus and the Patriotic March with all our hearts when we suddenly saw a brave warrior who could not even come to the window sill, borrowing a mirror from a nurse in the room and looking at our reflection. When we saw this, we were deeply moved. We had already said our goodbyes, but we felt that we could not leave just yet, so we asked the branch manager, "Excuse me, but please let us sing one more time", and then we sincerely sang the poem "Outside the city of Jinzhou". Afterwards, everyone outside also sang the "Baektu Mountain Song" and various other songs before we returned home. We were truly moved by the words of the head nurse who later told the branch manager, "The soldiers are all grateful to you for singing with such sincerity. As we stood by and watched, we could understand why everyone sang so willingly even after the farewell greetings had already been made. I believe that ties between Japan proper and Korea will be strengthened when hard and fast principles are set aside, and our hearts are in contact with one other". Photo The patriotic march sung by the comfort team at the Kokura Army Hospital, censored by the Shimonoseki Fortress Command Headquarters . Source 1 Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo August 18, 1943 Here are the patriotic Kisaeng Beautiful stories about the changes in the members of the performing arts comfort team Dispatch from Keijo Nippo head office Impressed by the fighting spirit in Japan proper At the time, the head office of Keijo Nippo organized a "performing arts comfort team" composed of Korean kisaeng. The group visited army and navy hospitals in various parts of the country, offering heartfelt comfort to the brave warriors in white. One of the members, Ms. Yoshiko Kaneshiro 22 , also named Ms. Kim Gang-seok 김강석 金剛石 , a kisaeng of the Sanwa Kenban Agency at 107 Hunjeong-dong 훈정동 薫井洞 , Jongno-gu, was deeply moved by the divine appearance of the fighting women of Japan proper who were working hard towards finishing the Holy War. She said, "I cannot stand still. I will become a serious woman on the war front and work hard for the sake of the nation". On August 17th, she reported to the Jongno Police Station and surrendered her four-and-a-half-year life as a 'red light' worker. x200B Kim Gang-seok, who gave up her work as a comfort woman after the tour. She submitted a notice of abandonment of the kisaeng trade, saying "Starting today, I will lead a serious life". At the same time, she deposited 100 yen in gold to the head office as consolation money for the Imperial military in commemoration of her giving up the kisaeng trade. She renewed her firm resolve to be an Imperial woman. Ms. Kaneshiro spoke of her joy at the beginning of her new life as follows Photo Ms. Kaneshiro . "I have recently visited the wounded and sick soldiers of the Imperial Military in Japan proper through the arrangement of your company. I was shown the true image of the fighting Imperial Nation, and taught the attitude of an Imperial woman. As a Korean woman, I was able to learn a great deal. In this critical time when we have to eat or be eaten, I continued the trip saddened that we had to live smiling under the 'red light' as kisaeng putting on a face that would have been more appropriate for more normal times, not able to do a thing to help our nation. After returning home to Korea safely, I reconsidered my life and decided to part with my life as a kisaeng and become a respectable family woman, so that I could send out more robust and loyal soldiers of His Majesty from the Korean peninsula, and I have done the necessary paperwork today. From now on, I will keep this inspiration in mind with the determination to live my life without shame as a sister and mother of splendid soldiers from the Korean Peninsula. This is a small amount of money, but it is a part of the cost of canceling the reception that was to have been held to commemorate my abandonment of the kisaeng trade, which had been made possible by the generosity of our guests. Please use this money for the sake of the wounded soldiers who were infinitely pleased with our humble Korean performances." Source 2 End of translation Notes The August 18th article is notable, in that it reveals a slight hint that at least one of the comfort woman was less than happy and even shameful about her line of work, as she announces her intention to retire to "live life without shame as a sister and mother of splendid soldiers of the Korean peninsula". The propaganda articles reveal a tension between the impulse to portray the comfort women's service as patriotic and honorable, and the contradictory impulse to portray the comfort women's work as shameful. The same contradictory impulses can still be seen among Japanese historical revisionists today who deny that comfort women were coerced and even applaud them for their 'service', but at the same time deny their suffering and flippantly dismiss them as willing prostitutes. The 1943 editorial article which I shared in a previous post attempts to reconcile these contradictory impulses by arguing that the comfort women's service was a sort of initiation rite to turn these comfort women into true Imperial Japanese women, and suggests that this 'initiation rite' could be used more widely to assimilate more Korean women into Imperial Japan. The First Army Hospital refers to what is now the National Center for Global Health and Medicine ncgm.go.jp in Tokyo. The Second Army Hospital, where the comfort team met Mr. Oyama the Korean volunteer soldier, was in Hiroshima, and it was wiped out in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Today, there is a memorial to the former hospital at the landmark 広島第二陸軍病院跡. The poem "Outside the city of Jinzhou 金州城外 " is about the Battle of Nanshan which was fought between Japanese and Russian soldiers on the southern tip of Liaoning peninsula in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War. Baektu Mountain Song 白頭山節 Youtube video of song refers to a Japanese folk song about Baektu Mountain which may be an adaptation of a Korean folk song. Kenban Agency 券番 refers to a management agency which manages the kisaeng and their performance fees. The Kenban agency for Kim Gang-seok was located at 107 Hunjeong-dong and is shown on this map of Seoul from 1933 x200B The Kenban agency for Kim Gang-seok at 107 Hunjeong-dong. x200B Today, the Kenban agency is gone, and the former location is now a part of Jongmyo Plaza Park screenshot of latest Google map of Seoul .

Title: North Korea copes with COVID by blaming South Korea
Content: North Korea copes with COVID by blaming South Korea I recently heard that North Korean dictators Kim Jong-un's sister Kim Yo-jong blamed South Korean leaflets for North Korea's COVID-19 outbreak. And I was shocked by some blockheads in reddit who agree with North Korea's claim. Well, it sounds plausible, but this is an unscientific propaganda for the next nuclear test and North Korea's internal solidarity. 1. The CDC announced the probability of surface infection of the corona to be 0.0001 . This probability is even lower under external conditions of sunlight and wind. - Findings of these studies suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the fomite transmission route is low, and generally less than 1 in 10,000, which means that each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing an infection x200B 2. In April, North Korea held a large-scale event no-mask , including the Day of the Sun. That time, corona virus was already spread in Sinuiju, which borders China. The reckless large-scale events at the time amplified the spread of Corona . In order to protect the supreme leader's dignity, North Korea can't acknowledge its failure in preventive measures. x200B Once again, I was amazed at the brutality of North Korea that uses the human catastrophe of a pandemic politically. Pray for who have been pitifully sacrificed in North Korea due to the corona virus. Pray for the comrades who unfortunately died of Corona in North Korea because they were unable to receive proper treatment. R.I.P

Title: Ordinary rural Koreans including men, women, elderly, little girls were forcibly worked to collect organic debris, animal manure, human feces/urine and make organic fertilizer to increase agricultural production for Imperial Japan's war effort (April 1944)
Content: Ordinary rural Koreans including men, women, elderly, little girls were forcibly worked to collect organic debris, animal manure, human feces urine and make organic fertilizer to increase agricultural production for Imperial Japan's war effort April 1944 This is my translation and transcription of three news articles from Keijo Nippo, a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of Japan-colonized Korea. They have never been republished or translated before, to the best of my knowledge. Ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues in the Internet Archive last October, I have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community. The following three articles are from April 1944, when Imperial Japan was into its third year of fighting an all-out war against the United States in World War II. Food shortages were rampant, and the pressure was on to increase food production at any cost. Chemical fertilizers were scarce due to war production needs, so the Imperial Japanese colonial government of Korea mobilized the whole country to increase organic fertilizer production using human feces and urine. I selected these three articles to help piece together what was going on. The first article describes a Volunteer Corps of young Korean men in one Seoul neighborhood hauling essentially human fecal sludge from bathrooms. The second article is a set of instructions on how to make organic fertilizer using organic debris and human feces and urine, digging pits, alternating layers of human feces and soil, and letting them sit to decompose. The third article is a very lengthy statement from the Governor-General s Office, addressed to all of Korea, giving orders on how to increase organic fertilizer production. Note that organic fertilizers are called 'self-supplied fertilizers' throughout this article. Despite their best efforts, chemical fertilizers apparently could not be avoided for growing seeds. Since this third article is such a tedious read, I ve bold-italicized some key passages to pay attention to. The government order expected everyone in Korea, including men, women, the elderly, little girls, to participate in this production. Labor was forcibly mobilized through the Patriotic Groups JP aikoku-han , KR aeguk-ban , 愛國班 the neighborhood cells which were the local arm of the Korean Federation of National Power 国民総力朝鮮連盟, 국민총력조선연맹 , the single ruling party of colonial Korea. If previous patterns held, then the government would ask the Patriotic Group leader the Korean collaborator intermediary for laborers example Who can you spare? , and the leader would volunteer these laborers from among the residents he knows in his own Patriotic Group example I think woman A and little girl B have some free time on their hands, and they can collect fallen leaves. I can volunteer them to you. Translation Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo April 21, 1944 Garbage Trucks in the City in the Dawn Dusk The cleaning service performed by the Palpan-dong Youth Volunteer Corps members Practice is better than theory. The Seoul Palpan-dong Youth Volunteer Corps, which had set out to take the initiative before ordering others to do so, began a cleanup campaign on April 11 in an effort to initially start work in a familiar location. This was to sweep the area of garbage and provide sanitation in the spring, and also to raise the health awareness of the residents at the same time. The corp members on duty gathered at 5 a.m. every morning at the Palpan-dong town council office. Under the command of Corps representative Hatani and under the orders of Captain Shigeyama, the Corps members silently worked breaking a sweat for two hours at a time to pump out the latrines and carry away the garbage before the townspeople even got up, and by 7 00 a.m. they were lined up in front of the town council office. They sang the Oath of the Youth Volunteer Corps. They strive to improve their minds and bodies as they each go about their work.

Home Gardening How to Make Fertilizer The shortcut to increase crop production is to double the amount of fertilizer, rather than to double the amount of land. Fertilizer is very important as a foodstuff for the crops, so let s treat our crops with homemade fertilizer. Fertilizers are the most important thing for growing vegetables, and they should be applied as a starter fertilizer at a rate of about 1 kan 3.75 kg for every tsubo 3.3 square meters of land. Dig a hole at least two shaku about 61 cm or 2 feet in depth, and throw in some dust, hay, straw, fallen leaves, horse manure, and anything else that will decompose. When you reach a thickness of 5 or 6 sun 15.1 cm or 18.2 cm , step on the mixture to make it more compact, and then sprinkle human feces, urine, and latrine juice over it. Then cover the human feces, urine, and latrine juice with about 2 sun 6 cm of soil. Repeat this process every three weeks, alternating the top-bottom order of the layers each time debris on the bottom and human feces on top the first time, debris on top and human feces on the bottom the second time, etc. . Cover the hole with a lid to prevent rainwater from entering. When the hole is full, leave the lid on for two to three months to complete the process. It is essential to let it fully decompose, otherwise it can cause more harm than good. Before applying it to the field, expose it to direct sunlight for three or four days, and crush it well before use. Human feces and urine also have rapid efficacy as an additional fertilizer to use after seeding. Place a bucket or tub in the soil, avoiding direct sunlight and rain. Stir the human feces and urine into the bucket or tub, let it stand for three or four weeks, and when it has sufficiently decomposed, apply a dilution of three to six times the original amount of the human feces and urine. When using this method, dig a shallow pit to one side of the crop, apply the fertilizer, and always cover it with soil. Source Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo April 26, 1944 Measures to secure fertilizers and animal feed Details regarding the Agricultural Promotion Association s stated policy part 2 Start by converting waste materials into animal feed Unfolding a campaign to increase self-supplied fertilizer production III. Measures to secure self-supplied fertilizer production In order to complete the agricultural production responsibility system imposed on Korean farming villages, it is necessary to increase the amount of fertilizers. However, since the situation is such that it is not possible to depend solely on chemical fertilizers, we must of course make every effort to increase the amount of self-supplied fertilizers. However, since the increase of self-supplied fertilizers requires a great deal of effort, we shall put the following into practice on the premise that the increase of self-supplied fertilizers requires the determination of the government based on the major policy of rural reorganization. 1 Movement to increase the production of self-supplied fertilizers In order to liquidate the chemical fertilizers are all-powerful mentality and to push forward with the improvement and increase of self-supplied fertilizers, first of all, to encourage the activities of guidance and encouragement organizations and agricultural groups to develop a spiritual movement among farmers, and, of course, to start a movement to increase self-supplied fertilizer production as a national movement by rallying the Korean Federation of National Power . 2 Rural Labor Mobilization Not only men, but also women and school children, shall be mobilized to work a certain number of hours every day for a certain period of time to increase the production of self-supplied fertilizers, and a work week shall be established. In this mobilization, not only farmers, but also non-farmers in general, shall share in the labor. 3 Implementation of a system of responsibility for increased production of self-supplied fertilizers A A system of responsibility for increasing the production of self-supplied fertilizers by village The target for increasing self-supplied fertilizer production by each farmer shall be set according to the amount of fertilizer required per unit of each major crop and per unit of production in accordance with local conditions, and each village shall be responsible for increasing its own respective self-supplied fertilizer production in the spring, summer, fall and winter, without missing the timings of production in each season. B Reward system for increased production of self-supplied fertilizers Farmers who reach the target of increased production of self-supplied fertilizer shall be rewarded by means of a certificate of passed inspection and special distribution of essential supplies. Landowners shall also be rewarded in an appropriate manner. 4 Strengthening of guidance and encouragement from government agencies A The Governor-General s Office is to expound the major policy of increasing the production of self-supplied fertilizers and mobilize all relevant authorities to strengthen guidance and encouragement for farmers. B The following guidance shall be given with emphasis. 1 Increase the production of field compost, quick compost, and wheat straw compost. 2 Increasing the use of wild green grass. 3 Construction or improvement of compost sheds, barns, ash houses, manure pits, and simple silos. 4 Conversion of rice bran, fallen debris, rice culm, stems and leaves of second crops, and sweet tea vines into animal feed. 5 Intercropping of fodder crops and utilization of vacant land. 6 Encourage and subsidize the adoption of green manure cultivation. 7 Utilization of muddy soil in irrigation and drainage canals and ponds, etc. 8 Collection of ashes from burnt waste grasses and trees in the urban areas and towns. 5 Thorough promotion of green manure cultivation A Strengthening the encouragement of increased production of self-supplied fertilizers through workshops on self-supplied fertilizers, product fairs, and awards for distinguished service. B Strengthen subsidies for facilities to increase the production of self-supplied fertilizers. C The Governor-General s Office shall increase the expenses required for the implementation of the above two items. 6 Parallel facilities A For the purpose of eliminating the adverse effects of the cost of burning rice culms as fuel in order to secure compost resources, the conversion to unhulled grain briquettes, etc., and the improvement of fuel holes of ondol heaters shall be promoted and encouraged. B Convert thatched rice straw into wheat straw to increase the use of rice straw as fertilizer and fodder. C In order to return the by-products of grain processing to the farming communities, the Foodstuff Brigade, which is the controlling body for grain processing, shall increase the production of feed by crushing the rice, wheat, bran, straw, and other materials produced at the factories to make rough animal feed. D To develop a cooperative movement among the people of the urban areas and towns to ensure that the waste of the urban areas and towns is converted into feed and fertilizer through rational processing of the waste of the urban areas and towns. 7 Specific measures to increase manure production in stables A Each farmer shall be required to install a composting shed, a storage area, or a manure pile, and to make use of the old facilities. B Have each farmer learn that without livestock, there is no fertilizer and raise livestock appropriate to the local conditions. C The farmers are required to do the one chige exercise before breakfast and to clean up their yards and villages every morning to obtain resources for compost or fodder, such as wild grass and dust. D Extend the mowing emphasis period, and constantly cut wild grass for fodder, bedding straw, and compost materials. E Open common wells in the vicinity of the village to facilitate composting, especially wells for field composting. F Agricultural wastes, straw culms, and leaves and stems of other crops shall be made into feed for livestock and returned to arable land. In particular, straw culms shall be saved as fuel or roofing, and about one-third of the production shall be used as raw material for stable manure. G To increase the amount of fodder by promoting the use of simple silos. 8 Utilization of human feces and urine A Farmers latrines and barns shall be improved, and manure pits shall be installed so that there will be no regrets in the use of human feces and urine and livestock manure and urine. B To promote transportation, relay facilities, and equipment maintenance to facilitate the use of human feces and urine from urban areas and towns. C In particular, vegetable growers in the outlying areas of the urban areas and towns shall be encouraged to organize associations and cooperate with the authorities to make use of human feces and urine from the urban areas and towns. D Conventional ash production shall be discontinued. 9 Thoroughly promote the cultivation of green manure. A In order to secure seeds, special distribution of chemical fertilizer shall be made to seed growers, and an increase in the price of green manure seeds shall be made. B Mobilize women and school children to supplement labor for seed collection . C Establish cultivation plans for each region according to the following goals for green manure types, and ensure that they are thoroughly disseminated. Southern Korea Mainly the Renge and Becchi brands of green manure Central Korea Mainly the Becchi brand of green manure Northwest Korea Mainly the Becchi brand of green manure D In areas where green manure can be grown as a second crop, it shall be cultivated to the extent of up to 30 of the rice paddy area. E In mountainous areas, wild grasses and sprouts shall be collected and used as natural green manure. IV. Subsidies for fertilizers 1. To grant the Korean Agricultural Promotion Association Prize to three places per province among the counties and townships for their excellent performance in increasing fertilizer production. 2. To receive subsidies from the Korean Agricultural Promotion Association for provinces that plan to engage in the green manure seed production business. I. Measures to Ensure Increased Fodder Production 1 Measures to be taken by farmers to increase feed production Thoroughly ensure self-sufficiency in animal feed The basic policy of farmers shall be to be self-sufficient in feedstuffs, and farmers shall be encouraged year-round to be self-aware and self-reliant in their work ethic and ingenuity. 2 Estimate the production amount of feed to encourage for each animal feed farmer, a secure cereals for feed b increase the production of quality hay c secure agricultural products such as culms and crop residues d collect agricultural crop stems and leaves e timely harvesting of tree canopy species f utilization of silkworm sand and mulberry leaves g preparation of buried grass and coal straw h cultivation of fodder crops on unused and fallow lands i dual use of organic fertilizers and other methods of increasing self-sufficiency in fodder production, to be implemented in accordance with local conditions, and to be secured as necessary. II. Feed measures for livestock requiring controlled distribution of feed 1 Securing the supply of rough animal feed Measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of rough animal feed such as hay and rice straw as basic feed. 2 Production and utilization of powdered feed Positively encourage the production of powdered feed such as apples, manure, coal straw, fish waste, etc., and make efforts to utilize them as a substitute for concentrate feed. 3 Securing supplies of concentrate feed Increase the supply of grains, soybean meal and bran, and prioritize the use of brewing sediment, starch sediment and other residues left over from production as animal feed to ensure a minimum annual supply of 250,000 tons. 4 Increase production and supply of formula feed Increase the production capacity of Korean Livestock Products Co., Ltd. to supply the most necessary concentrated feed as a rational and economical formula feed for each type of livestock. III. Measures to be adopted in particular in terms of feed 1 Develop a campaign to increase self-sufficient feed production In order to increase the production of self-sufficient fodder such as hay, wheat stalks, tree leaves, coal straw, buried grass, and other powdered feeds, a national campaign shall be launched throughout Korea to encourage farmers and strengthen the work of school children, elderly women, adult women, and little girls in particular , so that this can be accomplished. 2 Holding of a competition to increase feed production To hold a competition under the auspices of the Korean Agricultural Promotion Association to promote the development of new feed resources in line with the development of the above movement, and to contribute to its wide dissemination to the general public. 3 Securing the supply of minor grains for feed From the next rice production year onward, when establishing the food grain demand plan, the necessary amount of minor grains for feed shall be recorded and secured in a systematic manner. Allow ranchers, dairy farmers, stallion breeders, military-qualified horse breeders, etc. to cultivate the necessary animal feed. 4 Crack down on unauthorized movement of feed and unauthorized products shall be strengthened. 5 Actively subsidize feed facilities. 6 Expand and strengthen the feed administration system and improve the distribution system. 7 To expand and strengthen research and study facilities related to animal feed at agricultural experiment stations. Source My Notes This article mentions a one chige exercise that farmers were required to do before breakfast. Chige means bowl in Korean, but it s not clear to me whether this refers to their breakfast, or the container that they use to collect grass and dust for compost. In the following transcription, I encountered about six characters which I could not read despite my best efforts, so I placed a question mark as a place holder, until I could access a more legible copy of this article in the future, perhaps from the National Library of Korea.

Title: [Analysis] Creating an Atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula for North Korea's Next Military Provocation
Content: Analysis Creating an Atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula for North Korea's Next Military Provocation Despite the large-scale infection in North Korea, North Korea rejected previous offers by COVAX, likely because of international monitoring requirements, and has also ignored U.S. and South Korean offers of vaccines and other COVID-19 aid. And North Korea made a propaganda claim that South Korean leaflets are the root cause of covid outbreak in August. Last Thursday, North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un made the comments during a speech at North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament, where members passed legislation governing the use of nuclear weapons. The new law spells out conditions where North would be inclined to use its nuclear weapons, including when it determines that its leadership is facing an imminent "nuclear or non-nuclear attack by hostile forces." By using the corona pandemic as a tool for internal solidarity and declaring a nuclear attack on countries that threaten dictatorship, North Korea seems to be heading towards a military provocation rather than dialogue.

Title: Honest question, how long do you think North Korean regime will last before it eventually reunifies with South Korea?
Content: Honest question, how long do you think North Korean regime will last before it eventually reunifies with South Korea? I am to be honest, we are all 100 sure Kim Jong Un will remain in power for at least another 40 years he's 38 now and 78 in 2062, his grandad and dad ruled DPRK until the day they died in 1994 and 2011 respectively . Adding the fact that Jong Un will never give up nuclear weapons. So North Korea will remain on the world map at least until 2062. I don't think the Kim dynasty will survive with a 4th generation. As Jong Un's son was born circa 2012, he will be 50 in 2062, he will probably live in exile in Switzerland or Norway. A revolution will happen in the 2050s because by that time, North Koreans outside Pyongyang will have lived a subsistence existence for 100 years, they will feel that enough and enough. They can clearly see that DPRK has not developed economically since the 1950s. All the labor camps in DPRK will be turned into museums of atrocities committed by the Kim dynasty.

Title: Help us add Korean for Ukraine War Stories
Content: Help us add Korean for Ukraine War Stories Hello guys! My name is Vlad, I m the community manager of Starni Games. Our team is from Ukraine, working from our Kyiv office, despite the war. Right now we are making a game about the war in Ukraine - Ukraine War Stories. The full game is completely free no in-app purchases, etc a free Demo is available on Steam right now. We do not try to profit from this project. Our goal is to share the recent experiences of the people of Ukraine with a worldwide audience. Unfortunately, our Korean localization partner had to quit because of a force major after translating about 40 of the project. So despite our initial plan to have Korean, we risk not having it in the game at release. So, we thought maybe there are some people interested in volunteering to help us finish the Korean translation and make sure it is in our project. The project has around 40 000 English words. We would love to enable more people across the world to learn more about the Russian invasion of Ukraine - the game features over 10 languages. It would be a pity if we lose the Korean language. Ukraine War Stories is a set of visual novels about the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Set in the early months of the war, it tells the stories of civilians trapped on Russian-occupied territory. All stories are based on real events and eyewitness accounts. An important aspect is that we have a SOURCES button in the main menu with links to world-recognized media proving every episode we narrate in the game. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.

Title: Imperial Japanese security chief broadcast a speech to all patriotic groups in Korea, sternly warning Koreans against spreading fake news, including a bizarre rumor about a newly born baby cow with a human head which prophesied that Japan would win the war by September 1944, and then promptly died
Content: Imperial Japanese security chief broadcast a speech to all patriotic groups in Korea, sternly warning Koreans against spreading fake news, including a bizarre rumor about a newly born baby cow with a human head which prophesied that Japan would win the war by September 1944, and then promptly died This is my translation and transcription of an article from Keijo Nippo, a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of Japan-colonized Korea. This has never been republished or translated before, to the best of my knowledge. Ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues in the Internet Archive in October last year, I have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community. This article is a speech that the Imperial Japanese colonial security chief broadcast in 1944 to all the patriotic groups of Korea, which all Koreans belonged to. Each patriotic group leader would have assembled all their group members together for a mandatory regular meeting, and turned on the radio at 8 00 p.m. to force them to listen to this stern speech, warning them against spreading fake news. Basically, most Koreans were forced to listen to this threatening speech. One very bizarre rumor that this security chief mentions is about a newly born baby cow with a human head which said that Japan would win the war by September 1944, and then promptly died. The name of the baby cow was Geon 건 件 , named after the Chinese character 件 which consists of the human radical 人 and the cow radical 牛. Geon's name was invoked in debt acknowledgment documents, perhaps to swear in the name of Geon that the debt will be repaid, since Geon was supposed to be a truthful creature. This rumor apparently spread across Korea and even into mainland Japan. Patriotic Groups JP aikoku-han, KR aeguk-ban, 愛國班 were neighborhood cells which functioned as the local arm of the Korean Federation of National Power 国民総力朝鮮連盟, 국민총력조선연맹 , the single ruling party of colonial Korea. They typically consisted of a few households, led by a Patriotic Group leader, who normally acted as a mini-tyrant micromanaging the lives of everyone within the Patriotic Group. That included things like rationing food and goods, enforcing mandatory State Shinto prayer times and shrine visits, 'volunteering' laborers upon the colonial government's request, arranging marriages, holding mandatory Japanese language classes, spying on 'ideological criminals', etc. Translation Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo April 11, 1944 Don't get carried away by rumors! An enemy plot more terrifying than military force Broadcast to the regular meetings Proclamation by Mr. Yagi, Security Section Chief At 8 00 p.m. on April 10, Chief Yagi, the head of the Governor-General's Office Security Section, made a broadcast from the Seoul Broadcasting Station to the regular meetings of the Patriotic Groups, emphasizing the main points as follows 'Don't get carried away by false rumors!' Security Chief Yagi Some may think that there is no need now to repeat the statement 'Don't get carried away by false rumors!', but looking at the recent situation in Korea, we see that trivial 'false rumors' are flying everywhere and spreading. People are being misled by them and committing various unethical acts that break the wartime posture without a care in the world. This is the reality of the situation. Many have been punished for this. The enemy is not confined only to those who take up their guns and challenge us to war. Those who spread rumors and mislead the public are also clearly the enemy. They are enemies to be feared more than any military force, for nothing destroys the morale of the people more quickly than rumors, and nothing inhibits military morale more quickly than rumors. Rumors are a formless and sharp weapon that can be used in ideological warfare, because they confuse people's thinking and destroy their readiness to cooperate in war, thereby seriously affecting the completion of the Holy War. Our empire is poised to be absolutely invincible in armed warfare, and there is no need whatsoever to worry. The key to victory in future battles will depend solely on the victory or defeat of the people in ideological warfare and war production. However, when it comes to the people's attitudes toward this ideological warfare, regrettably, there are still some points that cannot be said to be perfect. As I mentioned earlier, the reality is that there are many rumors being spread throughout every part of Korea by all social classes, so it cannot be said that the entire nation has a firm belief in victory. They are carelessly saying things that anyone would consider to be false rumors that are far removed from the truth. Based on these false rumors, they hoard and panic buy in a hurry, they are reluctant to offer their goods for sale, or they hide their goods. It is truly regrettable that there is no end to the number of individualists who are only concerned with their own well-being. Those who take advantage of the Japanese people's relaxed and trusting nature to spread false rumors in an attempt to disturb their thinking should be called national traitors, working as pawns of the enemy, leading their thoughts into confusion, and sabotaging the Greater East Asia War. These are unforgivable acts at a time of national emergency in the autumn. One of the most boring and trivial recent rumors is this "There was once an animal named Geon 건 件 which had the body of a cow and the head of a human. When it was born, it said that the war will end with Japan's victory in September, whereupon it immediately died. Geon would never tell a lie. Writing 'Just like Geon' on a debt acknowledgment form is never a mistake. Geon made a vow with certainty, so the war will probably be over in September, just as Geon said." That rumor spread all over the place, so that Geon was allegedly born in Busan, then born in Wonsan and Seongjin now Kimch'aek, North Korea . Even in mainland Japan, Geon was also born in Nagasaki and Kagoshima. This rumor spread so much, that there were people writing letters about it. The feeling that the war will be over comes from the wish that it will be over soon. They will feel a sense of relief, and their hearts will start to relax. However, in the worst case scenario, if the war is not over by September, and their expectations are not met, it can be said that it is not impossible for people to feel disappointed and even pessimistic about the war. In some regions, there is a saying, "This year is a good harvest year, but there will be an epidemic of bad diseases. To avoid this, you should immediately make and eat adzuki bean porridge." This superstitious rumor has caused a great deal of confusion among the people, who were panic buying glutinous rice and adzuki beans. These are just trivial examples, but the results are truly horrifying. If the enemy were to spread counter-propaganda about daily life and the war situation that sound like the truth, and people fall for it and start spreading false rumors, then it would be a serious problem. Even if this is not the case, the number of groups buying goods will suddenly increase due to such rumors as "matches will run out," "the price of cigarettes will rise," "clothing will be placed under a ticket rationing system," and "miso and soy sauce will be rationed". What if this is the enemy's plot? Even if it is not a plot by the enemy, to be misled by false rumors and do such a thing on one's own is clearly to fall into the enemy's hands. If the crafty Americans and the British knew about this, they might stick out their red tongues in the shadows and punish the honest Japanese with their own hands. Each and every citizen must be very vigilant. No matter what false rumors fly, no matter when a shortage of goods may come, as long as we have the Japanese spirit and the Yamato spirit, we will not be misled by this and we will not complain or grumble. Right now, we must only think of winning the war. If only we cooperate in every way possible to win the war, that is all that is necessary. Those who forget to cooperate in this way and act in their own self-indulgent way are national traitors who have broken the war posture. It is safe to say that they are enemy people, and they must be dealt with firmly. What will be left after defeat in war? We will only become slaves of the enemy. War is now approaching closer and closer to us. It is literally dreadfully intense, and the generals on the front lines are engaged in a bloody struggle to the death. Our relatives have been honorably called to fight for the sake of their Emperor, for the sake of Imperial Japan, and they are fighting with a grim determination to win this war, even if their bodies are shattered to pieces. We who defend the home front must win. If we forget the feelings of these generals during this war and are misled by false rumors into committing immoral acts, we will not only be sorry to the generals on the front lines, but we will also completely lose the war on the home front. Let me repeat this again. The enemy is desperately waging ideological warfare. We must be careful not to fall for this and become national traitors ourselves. Source Edit Corrected Paragraph 7 to say "body of a cow and the head of a human", not "body of a human and the head of a cow". Sorry about the mistake. Transcription 京城日報 1944年4月11日 乗るな流言 武力より恐ろしい敵の謀略 常会向放送 八木保安課長檄 八木本府保安課長は十日午後八時京城放送局から愛国班常会向けの放送を行い 流言蜚語に迷うな と左の要旨を強調した 流言蜚語に迷うな と今更こと新しくいう必要はないと思うのであるが 最近の朝鮮内の状況を見ると到るところにつまらぬ デマ が飛び 流言が拡がっており これに迷わされ色々戦時態勢を破るような不徳行為が平然と行われているが 如き実情にある これがため処罰された者も少なくない 銃を執って我に戦を挑むもののみが敵ではない 流言を流布して社会の人心を惑乱するのも明かに敵である いな武力より以上に怖るべき敵である なんとなれば流言ほど速やかに国民の士気を破壊し 軍の士気を沮喪せしむるものはないのであって 国民の思想を混乱させ 戦争協力態勢を破壊して聖戦完遂に重大な影響を及ぼす敵が思想戦に用うる形なき鋭利なる武器であるからである 我が帝国は武力戦に於いては絶対不敗の態勢が整っており 決して心配はいらない 今後の戦勝の鍵は一に懸って国民の思想戦 生産戦における勝敗にあると申さねばならぬ 然らばこの思想戦に対応する国民の心構えはどうかと言う点になると 遺憾ながら一部には未だ完全とは申せない点があり 先程述べた如く沢山の流言が鮮内各地 各階層に流布されている実情から見ても 国民全体に確固たる必勝の信念が出来ているとは申せないのである 誰が考えても事実無限の デマ であると思われるようなことを平然といったり またこの デマ に基いて慌てて買い溜めしたり 買い漁りしたり 或いは供出を嫌がったり 匿したりする 自分さえよければよいというような個人主義者が跡を絶たないことは誠に遺憾なことと申さねばならぬ 敵が此の弛んだ然も何事でも信用し易い日本人の心につけ込んで盛んに デマ を飛ばして思想攪乱を図っているのを真に受けて デマ を飛ばすような人は敵国の手先となって国民思想を混乱に導き大東亜戦争の妨害をしている非国民というべきで 国家非常の秋に於いて許し難い行為である 最近の極めくつまらぬ流言にこういうのがある ある所に 件 という 頭が人間の体が牛 の動物が生れて今度の戦争は九月になれば日本の勝利の裡に終るといってすぐに死んだ 件というものは決して嘘を言わないものだ 借用証書に於いて如件と書くのは決して間違いでない 確実だという誓いであるから 此の件のいったように戦争は九月に済むだろう という流言が各地にある すると間もなく釜山にも生れた 元山にも 城津にも生れた 内地でも長崎 鹿児島に生れたという風に段々拡がって甚だしいのは手紙でそういうことを書き送る者も出て来た始末である 戦争が済むのだという気分は早く済んだらよいという気持ちから生ずる やれやれという安堵感を与えて心の弛みを生じ 悪くすると九月になって戦争の済まない場合には期待外れがして もういけない 駄目だという厭戦気分を生ずることさえないとはいえぬ 又或る地方では 今年は豊年であるが 悪い病気が流行する これを免れる為に直ぐ小豆の粥を作って食べるとよい という迷信的な流言が飛んだ為に 糯米や小豆の買い漁りで大混乱をした事例もある これらは実につまらない一つの例に過ぎないが その結果は誠に恐ろしいものがある ましてや敵が日常生活や戦況等について事実らしく逆宣伝をして来た場合 これに乗ってつまらぬ デマ を飛ばすということになると大変なことになる それでなくとも マッチが無くなる 煙草の値が上がる 衣類が切符制になる 味噌も醤油も配給になる などの流言によって急に買出し部隊が増えるという有様で これが敵の謀略であったらどうであろうか 敵の謀略でなくても デマ に惑わされて自らそういうことをすることは明かに敵の思う壺に嵌ったことになるのであって 狡猾なアメリカやイギリス人が知ったらなら蔭で赤い舌を出して此の手で正直な日本人をうんと懲らしてやれということになるかも知れない 国民の一人一人が充分警戒しなければならないことである 如何なる デマ が飛ぼうが 如何なる品不足の時が来ようが厳然たる日本精神 大和魂さえ持っておればこれに惑わされ 不平や不満は出ないと思う 吾々は現在唯戦争に勝つことを考えなければならぬ 戦争に勝つためにあらゆる協力をさえすれば それでよいのである この協力を忘れ流言を迷って一人よがりの行為をするものは戦争態勢を破る国賊であり 敵国人といっても差支えはないのであって 断乎処断すべきである 戦争に破れて何が残ろうか 敵の奴隷となるのみである 今や戦争は益々吾々の身近に迫っている 文字通り凄愴苛烈であって 第一線の将兵は血みどろの死闘を続けているのである 吾々の肉親は名誉の御召を受けて只大君の御為に 日本帝国の為にたとい身は粉に砕けようとも この戦争に勝たねばならぬと悲壮な決意で戦っておられるのである 銃後を守る吾々が勝たねばならぬ 此の戦争中に於いてこの将兵の気持ちを忘れ 流言に惑わされて不徳行為をするようなことがあっては前線の将兵に申し訳がないのみでなく 銃後の戦争に完全に敗れることになる 重ねて申し上げる 敵は必死となって思想戦を展開している 私どもはこれに乗って自ら国賊とならぬよう注意せねばならぬ

Title: Condemning North Korea's missile launch provocation
Content: Condemning North Korea's missile launch provocation Another ballistic missile launch by North Korea must be condemned as a "serious provocation that harms peace". North Korea's testing spree indicates its leader, Kim Jong Un, has no intention of resuming diplomacy with the US and wants to focus on expanding his weapons arsenal. The South Korean military said a pair of short-range ballistic missiles were detected overnight on Saturday, flying towards its eastern waters - the latest in the country's barrage of weapons tests in recent days. The recent weapons tests include a nuclear-capable missile that flew over Japan for the first time in five years and demonstrated a range to strike the US Pacific territory of Guam and beyond.

Title: North Korea fires missile toward South Korea Territory
Content: North Korea fires missile toward South Korea Territory North Korea fires missile toward South Korean territory North Korea fired more than 20 ballistic and other missiles, on 2 November, one of which landed in South Korean territory for the first time since the 1950-53 Korean War. The North also fired some 100 artillery shells into the East Sea. North Korea's provocation was effectively a violation of South Korea's territory by a missile that crossed the NLL for the first time since the division of the Korean peninsula , "A series of North Korean provocations would be punctuated by a nuclear test," expert says. "Although a test ahead of the U.S. mid-term elections could maximize its effectiveness, it would detonate a nuclear device at any point where it could draw attention." Isn't the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula impossible from the beginning by the North Korean dictatorship?

Title: The Nuclear Threat on the Korean Peninsula (1)
Content: The Nuclear Threat on the Korean Peninsula 1 The blessing bell and the threat alert rang at the same time on the Korean Peninsula in September 2022. The blessing came at the 2022 Emmy Awards on September 12. The Korean drama Squid Game won six Emmys, demonstrating the robustness of Korean pop culture after the Korean film Parasite won four Oscars at the Academy Awards in 2020. However, just three days before the Emmys, the threat came from North Korea, which declared, We will actually use nuclear weapons from now on for war, crisis, and the security of the regime. The North s conditions for the use of nuclear weapons were extremely broad, and its authority to use nuclear weapons was even enacted as a law. This is a major threat, as North Korea, a nuclear state, has begun gambling with the world. The threat is also immediate. During the tactical nuclear drills overseen by Kim Jong-Un before the founding anniversary of the Workers Party of Korea October 10 , North Korea fired short-range ballistic missiles SRBMs and intermediate-range ballistic missiles IRBMs and deployed over 150 fighter planes and long-range artillery representing the North s core military strength. Although North Korea used the excuse that the drills were simply aimed at responding to the joint exercises of South Korea, the United States, and Japan, its straightforward announcement of the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to training with conventional weapons reveals that the North s nuclear weapons are no longer for deterrence. Recently, North Korean state media has released images purporting to show last week s missile launches with a warning that the so-called reckless military hysteria of the United States and its allies is moving the Korean peninsula towards unstable confrontation Furthermore, North Korea's 7th nuclear test appears to be imminent. IAEA officially confirmed the fact two months ago, which was reaffirmed by the United States and South Korea. The whole world is tensely waiting and wondering when the North s next nuclear test will be carried out. If North Korea's 7th nuclear test succeeds, it is highly likely to become the world s 6th country to posses hydrogen bomb technology for an ICBM. Can we tolerate this situation of the world s poorest country, sustaining itself under a third-generation hereditary dictatorship, enjoying the status of one of the six nuclear missile powerhouses and threatening to use nuclear weapons indiscriminately? If the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is no longer effective, countries all over the world will increasingly develop nuclear weapons, which will grip the entire globe in the fear of nuclear war. There are so many reasons why we should refuse to tolerate North Korea s nuclear weapons. The third-generation leader s succession of the ambition to develop nuclear weapons has seriously threatened regional peace while driving many North Koreans to hunger. A recent study by Korea Institute for Defense Analyses indicated that North Korea has spent USD 1.1-1.6 billion in nuclear development over the past 50 years, which is more than enough to buy four years of food corn for the entire North Korean population. Experts point out that poverty and hunger, the chronic issues of North Korea, can be solved if the North gives up its nuclear weapons.

Title: So how long do you think it will take before North Korea completely destroys South Korea and annex it into their own?
Content: So how long do you think it will take before North Korea completely destroys South Korea and annex it into their own? I mean, it has been said that South Korea has 100 turned into South Vietnam due to recent events like media oppression, political opponents oppression, social conflicts, diplomatic incompetence, and the recent drone incident and all of those confirm that South Korean governments and military are completely useless paper tigers and that the whole country will get annexed into North Korea very soon - like, weeks, or days even. So in that regard, how long do you think it will take for South Korea permanently ceases to exist and becomes part of North Korea because they're taken over by the latter very easily in less than a day or so? P.S. I'm not trying to side with or glorify North Korea at all. I'm posting this because someone is saying this at least partly because of that North Korean drone incident I know that it's in Korean, so what I'm doing here is basically writing a translated TL DR version of this just in case someone who can't read Koreans might open that link.

Title: South Korea: 1948 - 2023?
Content: South Korea 1948 - 2023? I mean, that's what these North Korea experts seem to think My peninsula prediction for 2023 Between a handful and several score South Koreans will die in relation to a tit-for-tat military escalation with North Korea. Sorry to end the Xmas period on a downer, but it s getting harder to see how this won t happen as the days go by Updated prediction This happens in the next five months, max. Probably sooner. Not gonna be as brave as chadocl put a date on it, but I share Chad's pessimism. It is not in South Korea's interest to commit to escalatory retaliation as policy. Sounding tough doesn't scare North Korea, on contrary plays to their strengths, not ROK's. Ends badly. I'm skeptical that these immediate, proportionate demonstrations have the desired effect on North Korea presumably, the deterrence of additional action . This one is not from an expert, but I thought it might be important In the coming months DPRK is likely to wipe South from the map. So with all these confirmations that South Korea is going to be wiped off from the map by North Korea in 5 months or even less, when do you think this will actually happen and why?

Title: Western firms including Shell, Mobil, HSBC, Otis Elevator, Singer were active in colonial Korea, a US firm had a corn starch factory in Pyongyang, until the regime confiscated their assets with the outbreak of war, accused of having a 'Jewish spirit' which 'exploits the entire wealth of mankind'
Content: Western firms including Shell, Mobil, HSBC, Otis Elevator, Singer were active in colonial Korea, a US firm had a corn starch factory in Pyongyang, until the regime confiscated their assets with the outbreak of war, accused of having a 'Jewish spirit' which 'exploits the entire wealth of mankind' This is my translation and transcription of an article from Keijo Nippo, a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of Japan-colonized Korea. It has never been republished or translated before, to the best of my knowledge. Ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues in the Internet Archive in October 2021, I have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community. This is an article from December 1942, and it particularly stands out for its especially antisemitic, anti-American, and anti-British messaging. It is part of a series of articles written to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Pacific War against the United States, which began with the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7th local time December 8th Japan time in 1941. Setting aside the hateful content, this article provides a unique insight into the British and American corporations that were actively operating in Korea before they were confiscated by Imperial Japanese authorities about two months after the outbreak of war. x200B Abandoned Shell gas pump in Korea The article lists 15 British and American corporations actively operating in colonial Korea, including what were apparently joint ventures operating under the names of local companies, like Sakuma Industries, Pyonggang Industries, Unchang Industries, and a U.S. joint venture, Corn Product Refining Company, that apparently ran a corn starch factory in Pyongyang. Shell and Mobil had gas stations throughout Korea. Singer Corporation sold sewing machines to the Korean public under layaway plans. Other surprising appearances include HSBC, Otis Elevators, North British Mercantile Insurance Company, and Commercial Union Insurance Company. Unlike colonies run by Western countries, Imperial Japan allowed Western companies to come and operate inside Korea from the very beginning, when Korea was annexed in 1910. Western missionaries set up hospitals and schools, and mining operations were started by Western companies. However, leading up to 1941, restrictions against Westerners were gradually escalated. In April 1940, Westerners were no longer allowed to buy land in major cities and within 4 kilometers of railroads. In July 28, 1941, regulations for the control of foreign nations, aimed at U.S. and Philippines residents, were passed, and even stricter regulations were passed after the outbreak of war. I was able to figure out many of the company names and the above background information thanks to an excellent 2011 Japanese-language academic paper PDF entitled "The Management and Disposal of the Westerner's Property in Colonial Korea during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Pacific War and the Korean Liberation Period, 1937-1948", written by Ahn Jong-cheol 안종철, 安鍾哲 . However, further offline research will be needed to clarify some issues about this list. What company was "Compronpial"? My speculation is, maybe they misread the faded text saying "Compton" as "Complon", and the actual name of the company started with "Compton". There is no online historical information about many of the listed companies, including "Compton", Uo-oto pharmaceuticals, and the local companies, so the historical trail will have to be picked up offline in libraries. Translation Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo December 5, 1942 Roots stretched throughout all of Korea The epitomy of loan sharks, Totally reborn into a new wing of the war effort Shut out the United States and Britain! One year since the start of the Pacific War on December 8th Production Edition Of our country's total production, the amount of production that the Korean peninsula assumes as a military base of operations is redacted billion yen, or about 10 of our country's total production. The clutches of the enemy's capital extended even into this great peninsula's output. Before the war, the amount of the enemy's capital reached a total of redacted , turning the Korean peninsula into a bastion of American and British capitalism's aggression and exploitation of Greater East Asia by casting an insidious web of financial power. As soon as the Greater East Asia War broke out, at 10 00 a.m. on December 9 of last year, the Ministry of Finance issued regulations asset freezes for the control of foreign nationals. The Ministry of Finance issued a notice to the American and British nationals that all general permission orders would be forfeited. Even in Korea, the Enemy Assets Control Law was immediately enforced on December 12 of that year to actively control assets belonging to the enemy and quasi-enemy nationals. On February 7, the Enemy Assets Control Law was implemented for trading companies, especially commercial corporations belonging to the production sector. Here, the Japanese government confiscated enemy assets, which now play a role in the war aims of the new Japan that prospers as it fights. Active efforts have begun to use the confiscated enemy assets to supply the war effort. The following are some of the major confiscated enemy assets Firstly, the U.S. and British oil companies including Standard Vacuum Oil Company U.S. , Rising Sun Petroleum U.K. , The Texas Company China Limited U.S. , followed by Singer Corporation U.S. , Compronpial U.S. , and Nippon National U.S. . Japanese grain companies and others include Uo-oto Pharmaceutical Company U.S. , North British Mercantile Insurance Company U.K. , Tōyō Otis Elevator U.S. , Shinkō Cotton U.K. , Hongkong and Shanghai Bank U.K. , Commercial Union Insurance Company U.K. , Sakuma Industries U.S. , Pyonggang Industries U.K. , and Unchang Industries U.K. . The capitalization of these 15 companies amounted to over redacted million yen. The three oil companies alone had invested 450,000,000 yen. They built an oil depot in Busan and expanded their sales channels to all corners of the Korean peninsula, making a strong inroad into Korea's economic world and focusing on invasion and exploitation. They attracted attention by using the symbol of a heavenly horse or a shell-shaped mark on street corners. Gasoline stations and signage were also outlandishly set up in the streets. Those dens of U.S. and British aggression are still fresh in our memories, but in the first year of the Holy War, the people's determination to destroy the U.S. and Britain, their sworn enemies, successfully swept away the Americans and the British, and the stronghold of aggression that they had built over the past hundred years was replaced by the blade of justice that was aimed at their throats. The taxis, trucks, and buses that sped through the streets have now been replaced by fuel-efficient vehicles, and the triumphant songs of scientific Japan are now played in high spirits. Out of mischief, gas stations previously painted with bright red and yellow paint were reduced to signboards calling for the defeat of the U.S. and Britain. Yoshikuni Nakatani was newly appointed to become president of the U.S.-affiliated Japan Grain Company, which boasts a vast site and modern facilities on the banks of the Taedong River in Pyongyang with a capital investment of 780 million yen. He has been making strenuous efforts to increase food production for Japan, which is now fighting a new battle every day. In April 1930, the U.S.-affiliated company began manufacturing starch from Korean corn, with an annual production of redacted hundred-thousand tons. In the meantime, he paid 200,000 a year to the U.S. government for the use of a U.S. patent, and also manufactured high-grade oil and chemicals as by-products. The company expanded its sales channels not only within Korea and mainland Japan, but also in the Chinese mainland. They were literally enjoying the beautiful juice of exploitation, and they had cast and unleashed their plutocratic financial web. They have always exploited under the guise of "equal opportunity" and the welfare of mankind. It is the Jewish spirit to spread surplus money all over the world and exploit the entire wealth of mankind in all corners of the world. The Greater East Asia War is also a war to drive this Jewish spirit out of the land and skies over Greater East Asia. Their ingenious and extremely vicious dollar policies ate up nations and insatiably sucked the blood and fat of the world's humanity. The death struggles between Germany and the Soviet Union, the defeat of France, and the downfall of the Netherlands and other small countries were all the results of their schemes. We can all be taken in by their ingenious schemes before we even know it. A good example is the monthly installment sales of Singer sewing machines. When we think about the fact that most of the people to whom they sold these machines were meager monthly wage earners, and that most of them were using their meager paychecks to support their greed, we still become infuriated at the insatiable inhumanity of it all. The monthly installment system is a vicious business scheme designed by the U.S. to squeeze every last penny out of the world's poor. One year after the war began, the world's loan sharks, the U.S. and Britain, have been completely defeated, and even here on the Korean peninsula, the triumphal song of victory over the U.S. and Britain has been loudly proclaimed. All enemy facilities have now become activated as important parts of Japan's war efforts, rehabilitated as the driving force for the grand creation of Greater East Asia. The peoples of the Philippines, East Indies, Malaysia were previously deprived of their lands and had their nations destroyed, but they are now growing rapidly under the warm military rule of the Imperial Japanese forces. The world's loan sharks have been using all kinds of tactics to continue inflicting suffering. They want beds, clothes, hats, and even shoes to be paid for by monthly installments. It is more difficult to provide healthy lives to the people under such a system than it is for a great person to be born from perfectly ordinary parents. Moreover, their usual modus operandi is to hone in on people who are in difficult situations, beat up each and every member of the human race, and then seize their land after first wreaking havoc on the national characters of their nations.

Content: i sang an american song for locals in dprk awhile back, now worried hi all, i visited north korea as an american in 2017 on a week long tour in one segment of the tour, the tour guides brought us to something like a tavern where we had some korean beer and wine around some locals i noticed there was a guitar, i asked the tour guide if i could play and she allowed it. i picked a soviet song for the first one, on mars there will be apple blossoms by joseph kobzon. i told her the name of the song and she translated it for the locals. then i played another song, something in the way by nirvana. but i didn t tell her it was american. i started singing in english and they seemed less enthusiastic, but i might have been overthinking it. they still clapped once i finished it. but it was an american song. would the tour guide or the locals that heard it get in trouble? i know a lot of the stories about talking to locals in NK are bullshit but it s been something that s been plaguing my mind since it happened and i wasn t sure who to ask due to the uniqueness of the situation.

Content: In the event of an escalation to WWIII, with the primary belligerents being NATO, Russia, China, and perhaps Iran, do you believe there is a conversation to be had about an invasion of North Korea? If a unification of the Koreas happened, that would be the most likely circumstance. That said, I can't imagine they'd actually strike out in an overt war of aggression. They don't want a war with us. But if they moved to support any belligerents who are opposed to us, things could become quite complicated. What do you think?

Title: Assassination of 'Pyongyang Royal Family' in Seoul
Content: Assassination of 'Pyongyang Royal Family' in Seoul 1. Summary of the case At 9 pm on February 15, 1997, a man arrived at an apartment near Seoul from work. However, when he got off the elevator on 14th floor, two men dressed in black tried to kidnap him. A violent quarrel soon ensued, followed by screams and two gunshots. And these two men disappeared down the stairs. A woman who lived on the 14th floor was watching everything that happened in the hallway through the intercom. But she was shocked and couldn't do anything. Moments later she went out hallway. The man was shot in the forehead and chest and passed out with the words "spy, spy". He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died 10 days later, on February 25. He was 'Yi Han-yong' who worked as a PD for Russian language broadcasting at KBS World, a Korean broadcasting company. At the time, he was 36 years old. Right after the incident, the police found cartridge cases for Belgian-made Browning pistol that North Korean agents often use. And in October, it was confirmed that "the assassination of Yi Han-yong was the work of North Korean agents" from the arrested North Korean couple spies. Assault... Yi Han-yong was brain-dead KBS News, Feb. 1997 2. Who is Yi Han-yong? Yi Han-yong's real name is 'Yi- Il-nam' and he was born in 1960 in Pyongyang. Yi Han-yong originally lived an ordinary life with no direct connection to the Kim family. However, Kim Jong-il's obsession with women changed Yi Han-yong's life. In 1969, Kim Jong-il, who had a live-in lover in his 20s at the time, wanted Song Hye-rim, a movie star and married woman with a daughter. So he forced Song Hye-rim and her husband to divorce. After that Kim and Song began living together in secret, and in 1971, the eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, was born. Afterwards, he let her older sister Song Hye-rang and nephew live in his mansion, and all of them became like one family. However, in the late 1970s, Kim Jong-il shunned Song Hye-rim and started living with other women. Eventually, Kim Jong-il sent her son, Kim Jong-nam, to Switzerland to study, and kicked Song Hye-rim, her older sister, and nephew out to Moscow. The nephew of Song Hye-rim who was exiled to Russia is Yi Han-yong. In other words, he is Kim Jong-il's wife's nephew or Kim Jong-nam's cousin. Later, Yi Han-yong, who lived under North Korean surveillance in Switzerland, decided to defect in 1982. He disguised himself as missing in consultation with South Korean intelligence agency, and finally arrived in South Korea through five countries. Afterwards, he changed his name from Yi Il-nam to Yi Han-yong, entered 'Hanyang University' in Seoul, and in 1987 joined KBS Korean Broadcasting System as a PD in the International Department. He also married and had a daughter. However, at the same time, he received assassination threats from North Korea and hid own identity by plastic surgery. x200B 3. Why was Yi Han-yong assassinated? Yi Han-yong seemed to be settling down well in Korea, running a chocolate shop after leaving KBS. Then, in October 1995, he was contacted by his mother Song Hye-rang in Moscow. It was the first call in 13 years. After a phone call with his mother, whom he thought he would never see, he wanted his whole family to live together. The following month, in November 1995 in Moscow, Song Hye-rang met her brother Song Il-gi, who lived in South Korea, after 50 years. The First phone call in 13 years MBC News, Feb. 1996 Afterwards, she decided to escape North Korea's surveillance and defect to meet her son. In order not to provoke North Korea, she planned to seek asylum in a Western country first and go to South Korea a year or two later. In January 1996, Song Hye-rang escaped from Russia with the help of her daughter Yi Nam-ok, who had defected from North Korea in 1992, and succeeded in exile in Switzerland. In June 1996, Yi Han-yong published a book titled 'Taedonggang Royal Family' after her mother escaped the North Korean regime. In this book, he revealed scandalous personal life of the Kim family in North Korea, including how his aunt, Song Hye-rim, became Kim Jong-il's lover, Kim Jong-il's promiscuous drunkenness and sex life, and how he, his mother, and his aunt were exiled to Russia. Kim Jong-il ordered the assassination of Yi Han-yong when his hidden life was revealed. In January 1997, Choi Soon-ho and Yoon Dong-cheol, agents of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Culture, which corresponds to Cultural Exchange Bureau, infiltrated South Korea via China using forged passports. And on February 15th, they tried to kidnap Yi Han-yong to North Korea, but when he stubbornly refused, they assassinated Yi with a pistol on the spot. Afterwards, the North Korean assassins rode a submersible through the sea and returned to North Korea. x200B 4. After the Incident After more than 10 years of waiting, Song Hye-rang received the news of her son's death right before the reunion, and eventually did not come to South Korea. Instead, she traveled to various countries and wrote books about influential North Koreans who were abducted by North Korean authorities to soothe the pain of North-South separated families. Yi Nam-ok, younger sister of Yi Han-yong, who escaped from North Korea in 1992, stayed in England, married a Frenchman, and is known to live in Cambodia. Yi Han-yong's wife and daughter live a normal life without any special public activities. On the other hand, they are still afraid of the North Korean threat, as they moved quickly after the assassination of Kim Jong-nam in 2017.

Title: This Korean family in Seoul donated their metallic tableware in February 1943 to help Imperial Japan’s war effort, including their brass Sinseollo (신선로, 神仙爐), a prized cooking vessel that was passed down the generations from their ancestors in the Korean royal court
Content: This Korean family in Seoul donated their metallic tableware in February 1943 to help Imperial Japan s war effort, including their brass Sinseollo 신선로, 神仙爐 , a prized cooking vessel that was passed down the generations from their ancestors in the Korean royal court This is my translation and transcription of an article from Keijo Nippo, a propaganda newspaper and mouthpiece of the government of Japan-colonized Korea. It has never been republished or translated before, to the best of my knowledge. Ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues in the Internet Archive in October 2021, I have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community. This article shows a Korean man and his maidservant donating 32 brass items for Imperial Japan's war effort, including a brass Sinseollo 신선로, 神仙爐 , a traditional Korean hot pot cooking vessel which was apparently passed down the generations from his ancestors. Since this type of cooking vessel was traditionally only used in the Korean royal court, it seems that this Korean man came from a privileged family background. The fact that he had a maidservant attests to his wealth. Countless other historical cultural artifacts were likely donated in this way or confiscated and then melted down to make armaments for the Imperial Japanese military. Translation Gyeongseong Ilbo Keijo Nippo February 7, 1943 Brass items donated one after another "In times like these, it is shameful to keep such extravagant things stored away. Please use this Sinseollo, wash basin, and tableware to make torpedoes for destroying our hated enemies, the U.S. and Britain," said Ms. Katayama Tamae 44 years old , a resident of 6-103 Jongno-gu, Seoul. Upon her request, her eldest son Mitsuo 25 years old and her maidservant took 32 items including one brass Sinseollo, which had been passed down from her ancestors, a wash basin, and tableware and donated them at the main office of this newspaper on the morning of February 6th. Photo a mountain of brass items in front of Mitsuo and the maidservant Original caption a mountain of brass items in front of Mitsuo and the maidservant Source Transcription 京城日報 1943年2月7日 相踵ぐ 鍮器献納 この時局にこんな贅沢なものを死蔵しては申し訳ないことです どうぞこの神仙爐も盥も食器も憎い憎い敵米英撃滅の魚雷としてお役に立てて下さい と京城鐘路六の一〇三 片山玉恵さん 四四 は祖先伝来の真鍮製神仙爐一対をはじめ盥 食器など三十二点を長男光男君 二五 と女中に持参させ六日朝本社へ献納方を依頼した 写真 真鍮の山と光男さんと女中さん The metal collection campaign was escalated in March 1943.

Title: Assassination of 'Pyongyang Royal Family' in Seoul
Content: Assassination of 'Pyongyang Royal Family' in Seoul 1. Summary of the case At 9 pm on February 15, 1997, a man arrived at an apartment near Seoul from work. However, when he got off the elevator on 14th floor, two men dressed in black tried to kidnap him. A violent quarrel soon ensued, followed by screams and two gunshots. And these two men disappeared down the stairs. A woman who lived on the 14th floor was watching everything that happened in the hallway through the intercom. But she was shocked and couldn't do anything. Moments later she went out hallway. The man was shot in the forehead and chest and passed out with the words "spy, spy". He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died 10 days later, on February 25. He was 'Yi Han-yong' who worked as a PD for Russian language broadcasting at KBS World, a Korean broadcasting company. At the time, he was 36 years old. Right after the incident, the police found cartridge cases for Belgian-made Browning pistol that North Korean agents often use. And in October, it was confirmed that "the assassination of Yi Han-yong was the work of North Korean agents" from the arrested North Korean couple spies. amp x200B Assault... Yi Han-yong was brain-dead KBS News, Feb. 1997 2. Who is Yi Han-yong? Yi Han-yong's real name is 'Yi- Il-nam' and he was born in 1960 in Pyongyang. Yi Han-yong originally lived an ordinary life with no direct connection to the Kim family. However, Kim Jong-il's obsession with women changed Yi Han-yong's life. In 1969, Kim Jong-il, who had a live-in lover in his 20s at the time, wanted Song Hye-rim, a movie star and married woman with a daughter. So he forced Song Hye-rim and her husband to divorce. After that Kim and Song began living together in secret, and in 1971, the eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, was born. Afterwards, he let her older sister Song Hye-rang and nephew live in his mansion, and all of them became like one family. However, in the late 1970s, Kim Jong-il shunned Song Hye-rim and started living with other women. Eventually, Kim Jong-il sent her son, Kim Jong-nam, to Switzerland to study, and kicked Song Hye-rim, her older sister, and nephew out to Moscow. The nephew of Song Hye-rim who was exiled to Russia is Yi Han-yong. In other words, he is Kim Jong-il's wife's nephew or Kim Jong-nam's cousin.

Content: North Korea fired ballistic missile towards sea off east coast "North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile towards the sea off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula on Sunday, the South Korean military said, the latest in a barrage of weapons tests from the nuclear-armed state. The missile, which was launched from the Dongchang-ri site on the west coast at around 11 05 a.m. 0205 GMT , flew some 800 km 500 miles before hitting a target, according to a South Korean military statement. South Korea has condemned the series of recent ballistic missile launches by the North as a "clear violation" of a U.N. Security Council resolution. The launches have also prompted criticism from Japan and the United States. "North Korea's behavior threatens international peace and security, and is unacceptable," Japan's state minister of defense Toshiro Ino said at a news conference, adding Japan had protested strongly via North Korea's embassy in Beijing. In a statement, the United States Indo-Pacific Command said Sunday's missile launch does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or to its allies. But the recent missile launches highlight the destabilising impact of the country's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, it added."

Title: DPRK Story
Content: DPRK Story Once upon a time, the world had always viewed Kim Jong-un, the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea DPRK , as a villain who oppressed his people and caused misery in his country. However, that perception was about to change. It all started when a group of foreign journalists were granted unprecedented access to North Korea. They were allowed to travel freely throughout the country and interview anyone they wanted, without any restrictions or censorship. The journalists were surprised to find a country that was much different than what they had expected. They saw clean streets, beautiful parks, and modern infrastructure. They spoke to ordinary people who expressed their love and admiration for their leader, Kim Jong-un. They talked about how he had transformed their country into a prosperous and peaceful nation. The journalists were also surprised to see how much Kim Jong-un cared for his people. He personally visited hospitals, schools, and factories to ensure that everything was running smoothly. He talked to the workers and listened to their problems. He even took the time to play with children and participate in cultural events. The journalists reported their findings to the world, and people were amazed. The narrative about North Korea began to change. Countries that had previously imposed sanctions on North Korea started lifting them. People began to visit North Korea as tourists, eager to see the country for themselves. As more and more people visited North Korea, they saw the same things that the journalists had seen. They saw happy and healthy people, a vibrant culture, and a beautiful country. They saw that North Korea was not the dark and dismal place they had imagined. In the end, the world realized that Kim Jong-un was not the villain they had made him out to be. He was a good guy who cared deeply for his people and had worked tirelessly to make their lives better. North Korea was not the terrible place they had thought it was. It was a country full of promise and potential, with a bright future ahead.

Content: What was migration like during the Korean war? This is my first time really interacting with this sub, so I apologize if anyone thinks my question doesn't fit and belongs on a different sub. Anyways, I've recently taken an interest in learning about the Korean war and just finished 'The Coldest Winter America and the Korean War' by David Halberstam and just started T.R. Fehrenbach's classic 'This Kind of War'. I've also watched many interviews with American soldiers who served, and a semi-frequent point of discussion is the supposed mass migrations that took place, where Koreans fled from the north to the south, but never vice versa. Is there is any truth to this or is this an exaggeration by soldiers to believe they were fighting a just? Also, if these accounts are accurate, did it have anything to do with anti communist Kim regiment sentiments? I'm just trying to gauge how Koreans viewed the two governments at the time of the war.

Content: Shouldn't the Republic of Korea have it's very own nuclear deterrence? The thing is, when I dreamed of becoming President of the ROK in my youth, I thought of our country having its very own nuclear arsenal in order to show China, Russia, North Korea, and Japan who is boss. If Israel and Pakistan were able to get and keep their very own arsenal of nuclear weapons and would rather give them up over their dead bodies, why can't South Korea do the same? I do not care what the United States of America has to say and Taiwan should also have nuclear weapons in the very beginning. Thanks a lot Murica! It was a huge mistake for Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal to Russia and here we are today. The latter is now erasing Ukraine. It was also a monumental mistake we abandoned Taiwan for China and should stayed with the former to the very end. I would rather have Korea in possession of its own nuclear football than be erased from the map once more.

Title: Korean director of Straits of Chosun (1943) muted the war propaganda of this Imperial Japanese film to make it a humanistic story about young Korean man from wealthy family who enlists with a heavy heart to win his father’s acceptance of his lower-class wife, rather than from blind patriotism
Content: Korean director of Straits of Chosun 1943 muted the war propaganda of this Imperial Japanese film to make it a humanistic story about young Korean man from wealthy family who enlists with a heavy heart to win his father s acceptance of his lower-class wife, rather than from blind patriotism The following is my thorough transcription, translation, and in-depth analysis review of an intriguing piece of classic Korean cinematography, which is only in the Japanese language due to unjust colonial policies. Feeling that it is yet another piece of colonial injustice that this piece of Korean film history is inaccessible to Koreans because of the language barrier, I decided to spend some time studying this film. The Straits of Chosun 朝鮮海峡, 조선해협 1943 was a propaganda film produced with support from the government of colonial Korea to encourage young Korean men to volunteer to enlist in the Imperial Army. It wanted to show young Koreans that they could also become honorable Imperial soldiers just like the ethnic Japanese. Geum-sook and Seong-gi during happier times. It is 1943 in Seoul, Korea. Lee Seong-gi Rinoiye Seiki in Japanese, acted by Nam Seung-min is a young man from a privileged Korean Yangban family background who was kicked out of the house by his father for marrying Mihara Geum-sook Mihara Kinshuku in Japanese, acted by Mun Ye-bong a trusting, kind-hearted Korean woman from an impoverished family background. Seong-gi's father is a traditional Yangban man who cares about family pedigree, so he cannot let Seong-gi marry someone from a much lesser family background. Seong-gi 성기, 成基 leaves his lower-class wife, Geum-sook 금숙, 錦淑 , to join the Imperial Army in hopes that his father will finally become proud of him and then eventually relent to give his blessing to his marriage. Infuriatingly, Geum-sook's husband left her without telling her anything and broke off all contact with her, leaving his wife confused and distraught, but steadfastly believing that he will eventually come back. Suddenly finding herself without any income, she goes to work to support herself and her newborn baby, and gets from help from Eiko, her Japanese friend, Kiyoko, her husband's younger sister, and others along the way. She sees her husband marching in a military parade, and also tries to meet him as his train departs for the war front, but she just barely misses him. They both somehow end up hospitalized - he is recovering from his wounds in a war hospital in Japan, she is recovering from work exhaustion in a Korean hospital, and they reunite over the phone. Seong-gi's father finally accepts Geum-sook. Since the target audience was young Koreans, the colonial regime wanted this film to be made by and for Koreans. This is why this film has a Korean director Park Gi-chae , and the actors are almost all Korean, down to the Imperial Army soldiers who shout 'Banzai to His Majesty the Emperor!' The only credited Japanese actor is Tsubaki Sumie who plays Eiko, the ethnic Japanese friend of Geum-sook. Many well-renowned Korean actors make their appearances with superb acting performances, including Nam Seong-min playing Seong-gi , Kim Il-hae playing Seong-gi's father , and Mun Ye-bong playing Geum-sook , who became a decorated North Korean actress after the war. One of the songs of was sung by Park Hyang-rim a famous singer who tragically did not survive the war. Ironically, this film made by and for Koreans was not allowed to use the Korean language due to draconian colonial policies at the time, so that is why all the dialogue in this film is in the Japanese language. Nevertheless, the Koreanness of this film still stands out in the way the film visits well-known locations in Seoul and depicts the everyday lives of the Korean people of Seoul. This film may superficially look just like any other Imperial Japanese war propaganda film at first glance. Geum-sook serves in the war by working in a factory and then raising her son to become a fine soldier, while her husband fights on the battle front for Imperial Japan. Japanese-Korean Unification themes also pervade this film. Geum-sook's Japanese friend Eiko is the impetus in injecting human kindness into the family, first by befriending Geum-sook, and then by inspiring Seong-gi's sister to become the voice of reason by bringing the traditionally minded parents and the earnest daughter-in-law together. However, researchers have actually found this film very strange and atypical for its genre. Whereas other Imperial Japanese war films has soldiers willing to die gloriously and joyously for the Emperor, Seong-gi is motivated to enlist not out of blind devotion to the Emperor, but rather out of a simple desire to earn his father's approval to legitimize his love marriage to his wife. There is also no sign of Seong-gi actually enjoying being a soldier. Unlike other war films where soldiers go off to war confident and carefree, Seong-gi goes off to war with his heart worried and unsettled, since his wife still has to experience hardships and his father still disapproves of his wife while he is fighting. Thus, the Straits of Chosun is quite remarkable for depicting the realities of war service in such a complex light. In other words, this war propaganda film turns out to be less of a war mongering story, and more of a humanist story about one strongly Confucian family that transcends the bounds of tradition to welcome one gentle, kindhearted woman into the family through human kindness. It is for this reason that there is speculation in the blogosphere that director Park Gi-chae may have subtly added other subversive subtexts and undertones into this film. For example, Seong-gi's father is depicted as a very unlikable, extreme Imperialist ideologue, a very unflattering depiction of the real-life Imperialist propaganda that pervaded colonial Korea at this time. One reviewer even ventures to say, " Straits of Chosun accidentally makes an argument for liberal modernity in which men and women are equal partners in their shared endeavour, the class system has collapsed, and the individual has the right to determine their own destiny free of familial obligation ." I wouldn't go so far as to say that. The colonial regime's intention with this film was to release Koreans from familial obligation, so that they could volunteer for enlistment more freely, encourage more women into the workplace, and make everyone an Imperial subject with a single-minded devotion to the Emperor. However, it is admittedly easier to read such subtexts into this film, when the war mongering element of this war propaganda film is so unexpectedly muted. As hinted by the cherry blossoms that dominate the film, much of the filming was done during March April 1943 in Gahoe-dong, which was traditionally an exclusive area for nobles, scholars, and residences of government officials where there are many beautiful trees Source Keijo Nippo April 17, 1943 The film was said to be an "unprecedented box-office success for a Korean film" when it was released on July 29, 1943 Source Terukuni-Sanjin Blog . Some 138,750 people were said to have watched this film in Seoul, Pyongyang, and Busan. This film was actually rediscovered in 2005 by the Korea Film Archive survey team who visited the China Film Archive in Beijing. A copy of film was left in Hubei, China by retreating Japanese forces, then picked up by victorious Chinese forces, and then archived and copied by the Chinese authorities after the war. Since so many films from that era were lost or destroyed, it's a fortunate thing that this one somehow survived against all odds. This Google Arts and Culture page shows more materials from this film, including a souvenir group photo that shows all the actors. This film was persumably sponsored by Riyapapa Cream and Movian Cream, whose product placement ads can be seen in random locations beside a family photo, on a window in Geum-sook's house. Whashin Department Store may have also sponsored this film, because it features prominently in one scene where Eiko goes on a shopping trip with her friends to buy baby clothes for Geum-sook's baby. I've posted a video with my Japanese transcription and English subtitles here Credit to classicalmovieanimation3151 for posting this video. The following is a longer plot summary with some bookmarks to specific time marks in the film for accessibility.

Eiko takes Geum-sook for a nice stroll at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, where Eiko suggests that she forget about her husband, and that she could ask her husband's family for help, but Geum-sook stays steadfastly loyal to her missing husband, insisting that she can handle this kind of hardship.

Eiko then meets Kiyoko at a coffee shop and offers her help. However, Kiyoko is unsure if Geum-sook would accept the baby clothes, explaining that Korean culture has a lot more rules and customs to consider than in Japan. Nevertheless, Eiko persuades Kiyoko to offer the baby clothes to Geum-sook. Eiko and her two Korean friends pick out baby clothes at Whashin Department Store. 32 36 Later, Kiyoko's father warns her to never let Seong-gi know about the baby. Heeding her father's orders for now, but unable to forget about Geum-sook, Kiyoko visits Geum-sook and offers her the baby clothes, but Geum-sook rejects them. 36 46 Geum-sook gives birth to a baby boy at home, assisted by a team of friends and a midwife.

Title: Expats and Citizenship in DPRK
Content: Expats and Citizenship in DPRK For a while, I'd have an on again off again interest in exploring the various expat subs to see what people are up to, be it discussing their life in another country, talking about the naturalization process, or looking for advice on how to get started. The same applies for checking out Wikipedia's extensive pages and hearing from naturalized citizens on Youtube. While I was browsing one of the subs, there was one user I remember, albeit probably a joke, who had the flag for DPRK in his flare. This had me curious about how, if one wanted to move there and become a citizen for whatever reason, how you'd even go about doing that. I know about the various defectors who spent much of their lives there, but is there even an active community of people who are trying to follow in their footsteps now?

Title: The Korean War begins in 1950, when the North Korean army backed by Soviet Union and China, crosses the border and attacks South Korea, starting a 3 year conflict, that would leave around 2-3 million dead and devastate both nations.
Content: The Korean War begins in 1950, when the North Korean army backed by Soviet Union and China, crosses the border and attacks South Korea, starting a 3 year conflict, that would leave around 2-3 million dead and devastate both nations. The backdrop to the Korean War was the country's partition after WWII, with both the US and Soviet Union staking claim, and trying to gain influence. With both the Governments claiming to be the sole legitimate Govt of the entire Korean peninsula, and not accepting the 38th Parallel, tensions began to escalate. And the North Korean Army crossed the border, beginning the War. The UN Security Council authorized an allied force to support S.Korea that included US, UK,Australia and the entire Western block, while N.Korea was backed by Soviet Union and China, making it the first major global conflict of the Cold War. While the US-South Korean alliance, initially suffered heavy reverses, and retreated to the Pusan perimeter, the large counter offensive at Incheon in September cut off the North Korean army, and made them retreat back, as the UN forces entered the Northern part. However China's direct intervention in October 1950, totally changed the course, as the UN Alliance was pushed back and by December, the Chinese forces had advanced into the South. Seoul was captured no less than 4 times,the city was totally devastated, however the Alliance struck back and soon it became a war of attrition with neither side really gaining much. There was massive bombing carried out by both sides, though North Korea suffered more, around 2-3 million civilians dead, massacres carried out by both the sides, and the devastation of all the major cities in the Korean peninsula. The Korean War ended on July 27, 1953 when the Armistice was signed creating the DMZ to separate both the Koreas.And a nation divided that to date, is a painful memory for all Koreans on both sides. x200B x200B

Around 1764, what were the events unfolding in Seoul or Pyongyang at the time? What was life like for both average and elite Korean citizens during that era? What type of government did North South Korea have at the time period? What were diplomatic relations between Korea the US like back then?

Wouldn't it be better for him to live in peacefully than bear the weight of running this crazy country? Does his pride worth more for him than always worrying about his life from inside or outside threats? Or China is the one who not allow this because they need NK to oppose US influence? Or in KJU's view his country is perfectly "normal" and does not have any remorse that his people are suffering? He should be aware of this.. If he would take this offer he should get almost anything he wants, VIP protection, money, anything is better than let millions of North Koreans suffer anymore... Would be far more cheaper than to keep and entire US army in South Korea...

Content: Unpopular opinion North Korea is better than South Korea Sure, North Korea might be a communist state, which I am not a big fan of, given the fact I was born in China and moved to America because I hated communism, but it is still miles better than South Korea, which is overrun by fascists. All the people I see in South Korea are basically a joke pink haired with tattoos, the men in South Korea look very feeble and they are literally imbeciles, especially the K-Pop idiots. North Korea has proper looking women who are truly beautiful with black hair, pale skin, and the like, while the women in South Korea look like dyed hair idiots. South Korea is also not a high tech and rich country. These are propaganda from South Korea to try to make you think they are rich and to make you think Samsung is not based in China, but Samsung really is based in China. I visited South Korea and slums are everywhere. People are living in poverty, looking very weirdly with pink hair and all those stupid shit.

This year, I was selected for North Korea ironically I am south korean lol and the focus topic is the rising tensions between China and Taiwan and other related topics, like the dedollarisation of the world, threat of nuclear warfare and increasing conflicts between the US and China . I have been researching about North Korea and I am aware that my main enemies are the US, South Korea and Japan and the European Union . But I am not sure on how to defend myself against the human rights violations, production of nuclear weapons and missile tests accusations that will probably be brought up by other students, while also criticizing these countries effectively. I am sorry if the request is confusing, English isn't my best language.

Title: North Korea recently called South Korea "ROK"(in Korean), and why this matters at all.
Content: North Korea recently called South Korea "ROK" in Korean , and why this matters at all. The south korean news outlet recently published in their article, that North Korea used the official name of South korea ROK ,in korean Dae han min guk in their official statement made by Kim Yo-jong.Now for those who are from overseas who are not korean might say oh the dprk and the rok called each other in the united nations with their official names so would wonder why this is such a big deal. The thing is this is because before, the north korean gov called the south korean government south korea Nam Chosun in north korean or the south korean puppet government Nam chosun goeroe in their statements.The reason why they called it south korea at all was because this emphasized the fact that the southern part of the peninsula was occupied by "the colonial gov of the united states" or a puppet regime, while also suggesting the region has korean people living there, which have same origins as the north koreans.Since south korea and north korea both view each other as illegal occupants, but partners in a future unlikely korean unification event, the govs of each countries have historically chosen to use terms like south korea and north korea to anticipate future unification justifcation to their side of the government. But now that they call south korea by the term Daehanminguk, the scholars are making their own theories about it. First,they are trying to alienate South Korea and treat it as a different country rather than an illegal occupant of their peninsula...unlike nam chosun which has the ethnic name chosun that is shared with the official korean name of the dprk chosun minjujuui inmin gonghwaguk,the name daehanminguk does not imply a connection in korean with the dprk at all in terms of its nation or even blood but just a different country. this is why the dprk recently began to address inter korean matters not through the inter korean ministry, but through the foreign ministry . Second, the move is trying to solve problems associated with their new tactical atomic bomb project whicj targets south korea.Since south korea implies they are part of the same nation, this might hurt the propaganda on the nortern side when south is considered to be a region that should be "freed". Third, some scholars suggest that it actually is a move deliberately made because the north korean regime is in a crisis. This opinion is inspired from how the inter german relations went in the 1980s, when the DDR tried to officialize their independent government by abandoning their unificafion objectives and tried to think of it as a totally different nation from west germany but as you guys know DDR later fell shortly after .What do you think is going on here?

It's very fun to see how silly these get at times lol, but I'm not sure on the blue jeans thing for example, that seems to be so reocurring that I start to believe it is true.

Are Koreans aware of this prevailing theory held by linguists outside of Korea that Koreanic is not indigenous to the peninsula and that the two language families Japonic and Koreanic are unrelated? Do they have a rebuttal to this?

Title: Honestly, it’s hilarious to see Neo-Cons and Communists online fight over the Korean War. I mean, it was America’s fault for approving Russia in taking inches of Korean territory now they had taken miles of it. Also, the Kims, Rhee, Park, and Chun are monsters. Period.

Title: Typhoon Kanun to Travel from Okinawa to Korean Peninsula: This Means the Jamboree at Saenangeum is Finally Kaput: Lord Have Mercy
Content: Typhoon Kanun to Travel from Okinawa to Korean Peninsula This Means the Jamboree at Saenangeum is Finally Kaput Lord Have Mercy Typhoon Kanun has already killed two people in Okinawa. And the Scout headquarter in Geneva is taking no chances. They have agreed with South Korea's organizers to abandon the Saemangeum site and move to alternatives sites to complete the 2023 Jamboree festival. President Yoon has been told about some of these contingency plans Well, the crux here is that some of the participants have already moved out of Saemangeum for reasons unrelated to the coming typhoon. We don't need to rehash the reasons here and there will be a time of reckoning for South Korea's organizers who have manifestly demonstrated their utter incompetence. The most likely scenario is that the majority of the Jamboree participants will be moved to the capitol region of South Korea --- that is, the Seoul metropolitan area which includes Incheon and other satellite cities in the Province of Gyeonggi. Weather permitting, they will be able to take advantage of the area's abundant resources to enjoy their remaining stay. Indeed, South Korean corporations are pitching in and more organizations are expected to mobilize to "save" this year's infamous Jamboree. Samsung has already deployed their medical staff from its hospitals, which are among South Korea's Big 5 teaching and research hospitals, to the Jamboree site. The Daiso discount store chain is donating "cool scarves," i.e., scarves designed to cool body temperature during humid summer months. HD Hyeondai already sent 120 volunteers to the site to oversee maintenance of washrooms and other facilities. Samsung had also sent their "new hires" to Saemangeum to be "apprenticed" there to learn presumably about public relations and "crisis management." In other words, some South Korean corporations have already adopted the Saemangeum Jamboree fiasco as a textbook case to learn about mismanagement and how to engineer "turnarounds." Good for them but they are for-profit corporations with bottom lines to worry about, not publicly-funded organizations like the Jamboree organizing committee and Joellado's oversight and marketing arms that ran this Jamboree to the ground.

Title: For those of you who are in South Korea, when are you planning to evacuate to Japan or the United States?
Content: For those of you who are in South Korea, when are you planning to evacuate to Japan or the United States? Again, I'm not trying to glorify North Korea at all, but you might want to take a look at this This is in Korean, but basically, it says here that North Korean military parade from July 2023 showed that their military is rapidly modernizing to a point where it's catching up South Korean military very soon or has even surpassed it already and given how North Korean soldiers are getting much better in shape ? and is now equipped with weapons like 9K135 Kornet, MQ-9, New Star-9 새별-9 , New Star-4 새별-4 , and M-2020 that are fully equipped with APS hardkill ? , which South Korean military doesn't really have - all thanks to North Korea-Iran-China-Russia relationship getting stronger with 3 latter countries fully helping North Korea, leaving the United States no choice but to abandon South Korea and Taiwan and redirect all of their focuses to Japan in very few days, meaning that if the war happens now, they will able to take over South Korea in less than a day completely on their own. So considering this, when are you planning to move to Japan or the United States to start a new life in one of those countries?

Content: I've noticed some people downvote me for my posts. I assume some think I am pro DPRK due to my titles. The titles chosen are literally the titles of the videos I've posted. Some vids are pro DPRK regime propaganda. I did not invent these titles. If you dislike my content downvote only then pls thx Just quit downvoting me due to the titles of the original vids I'm publishing to reddit. They aren't titles I've created. If a group of redditors dislike particular types of videos that I post, please share why and I will post less of those videos. If there's anyone who likes a particular type of content I post, also feel free to share here in the comments and I'll post more of that content. Just don't downvote me to oblivion because I posted a title that matches the video or the og title of said video s . I'm sorry if you don't like propaganda. If more than a bunch of people here comment under this thread that they'd like to see less of a specific genre of content I won't continue to post as much of that specific type of content. If you do enjoy other types of content remember to share which types you are fond of or would like me to share more of. I'm just trying to keep this sub interesting and alive daily. That's all. Thank you. Lmfao someone down voted me already just for saying this assume it's the same weird ass who went through all my vids just to do so Mods really need to empty the trash in terms of the trolls here.

Title: How can we as Americans help to influence the class culture of South Korea and Japan in a positive way?
Content: How can we as Americans help to influence the class culture of South Korea and Japan in a positive way? I know we are close allies to them, and our culture has heavily influenced theirs in many ways. But how can we instill our values of class egalitarianism into theirs? I think they could learn so much from the US when it comes to this.

Title: Here are some DPRK stamps
Content: Here are some DPRK stamps I am a collector of stamps, and I believe that the DPRK has many great issues. Albeit most are used for export markets instead of domestic use, there is some really pretty pieces I've got ahold of. I hope to get more modern pieces from the 2000s-present. Here is a video of two of my special albums, and this one is my First Day Covers and Postcards. A useful site to learn more about DPRK stamps is Colnet! it has a great collection of images and technical information about stamp sets and different formats. I would love to get ahold of some real early pieces, from 1949-1960 as the stamps were considerably different than they are now. I am sure this community may like these things, despite lots being propaganda based it's very beautiful and interesting to look through.

Title: Is North Korea Truly Hopeless?
Content: Is North Korea Truly Hopeless? I have been encountering recent news about North Korea treating their people like trash and imprisoning or killing defectors who want a better life. The country has been running under heartless people for years and yet, nobody aside from a few is doing anything to fix it. Even with the few NGO's out there, it feels like all of their work keeps getting destroyed by North Korea making it harder for people to escape. Plus, there are always talks and news about change from South Korea or the United States talking about North Korea, yet nothing actually comes from it. Because of this, it's making me feel hopeless and sad for the people living in such a horrible dictatorship. Do you think it's possible for any good change to happen or is it all for nothing?

Title: How is Stalin viewed in the DPRK?
Content: How is Stalin viewed in the DPRK? It's well known that Joseph Stalin helped form the DPRK into what it's known as today. My question is, how is Stalin viewed in the eyes of the North Korean people? We know that the 3 Supreme Leaders are considered sort of gods in that society. Are they taught about Stalin? Is he a positive figure in the DPRK's taught history? Simply just someone who helped Eternal Leader Kim Il Sung bring North Korea to supposed victory? Or is he not regarded as someone important? Please let me know!

Title: Unpopular opinion: North Korea is better than South Korea
Content: Unpopular opinion North Korea is better than South Korea Sure, North Korea might be a communist state, which I am not a big fan of, given the fact I was born in China and moved to America because I hated communism, but it is still miles better than South Korea, which is overrun by fascists. All the people I see in South Korea are basically a joke pink haired horny and seducing girls with tattoos, the men in South Korea look very feeble and they are literally imbeciles, especially the K-Pop idiots who play fake music instead of the authentic European or Chinese classical music. North Korea has proper looking women who are truly beautiful with black hair, pale skin, and the like, while the women in South Korea look like dyed hair seducing idiots. South Korea is also not a high tech and rich country. These are propaganda from South Korea to try to make you think they are rich and to make you think Samsung is not based in Europe, but Samsung really is based in Europe and Hyundai is based in Japan. I visited South Korea and slums are everywhere. People are living in poverty, looking very weirdly with pink hair and all those stupid shit and the reason why people in South Korea live in poverty is because they buy dumb shit such as plastic surgery and hair dye to pretend to be European even though they look like tacky Kazakhs or mixed-race at best.

Title: Why does North Korea's Kim Jong-un travel to Russia by train instead of plane?
Content: Why does North Korea's Kim Jong-un travel to Russia by train instead of plane? North Korea leader, Kim Jong-un owns a official airplane . However, he avoids using it for international trips. The reason behind this decision is Kim Jong-un's lack of trust in the safety of his official airplane. His plane is an 'IL-62M,' a model from the former Soviet Union purchased in the 1980s. Due to its age, long-distance flights on this airplane are nearly impossible. Moreover, North Korea lacks experienced long-distance flight captains. North Korea's Air Koryo operates only flights to Beijing, China, which is approximately 900 km away. Even when Kim Jong-un visited Singapore, he chose to take a Chinese plane due to his cautious nature. This preference for trains over planes is a tradition that extends to Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, Kim Il-sung. The reality in North Korea is that it cannot guarantee the safety of even one aircraft used by its supreme leader.

Content: r NorthKorean needs members- the only sub on Reddit created and run by a real North Korean defector family! Anything goes as long as you abide by reddits basic policies stay on topic! All opinions welcome! All Dprk related content welcome! Mods needed! I ve posted this here once before since this has been my favorite subreddit since I ve joined the app. However there is now a two limit post per day rule here and other rules such as being against propaganda which is a bit confusing since no matter whether or not your content is North Korean created or non North Korean sources talking about North Korea it is almost always in some way shape or form propaganda. My parents who were born and raised in the Dprk are willing to participate in helping me answer questions and comments once the sub becomes active with members curious and eager to learn and engage more and garner more insight into the worlds most secretive country to date. Please come and join us over at r NorthKorean where anything and everything related to the Dprk is welcome and where nobody is shamed for their views. I will probably continue to post basic news to this sub but due to the content limit rule all of my obscure videos that show rare insight into the lives of average DPRK citizens , news reels taken straight from KCTV, NK made cartoons and documentaries and my personal participation as the daughter of defectors alongside their participation in regards to answering any questions people have about the hermit kingdom will be uploaded to the new r NorthKorean sub. Thank you to the mods here for allowing me to post this , engaging with the Reddit community on the topic of my families culture and heritage is a very special hobby and has helped me immensely on my journey in substance addiction recovery at a time where I need to keep focused on things I enjoy such as this being my main free time activity. I respect your guys rules and truly am grateful for y all allowing members to join my sub a sister sub if you may allow me to call it- mods here are welcome to ask for modship on r NorthKorean anytime the only difference is multiple posts are allowed daily and so is anything on topic allowed also including what this sub may consider as propaganda .

Content: Why were North Korea security embarrassed when they saw Kim Jong-un's chair? Just before the summit with Russian president Putin, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un's security were very embarrassed when they saw Kim Jong-un's chair. Because the chair had an unusual shape, having two legs. Kim Jong-un weighs over 300 lbs. If a chair breaks during a meeting, the security will be executed. They tested if the chair was strong enough to bear his supreme leader's weight. And they suspected that the chair had been poisoned. North Korean security official in white gloves wiping down Kim Jong-un's black chair and spraying an unidentified substance. The person sprayed and wiped down the seat, the hands, the legs. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un doesn't seem to trust Russia either.

Title: Japanese YouTuber YUIPYON verbally attacked by North Korean defector in South Korea over Japanese colonial historical grievances; his grandfather was killed by the Japanese, and he wanted to "kill all Japanese"
Content: Japanese YouTuber YUIPYON verbally attacked by North Korean defector in South Korea over Japanese colonial historical grievances his grandfather was killed by the Japanese, and he wanted to "kill all Japanese" On September 17th, a Japanese YouTuber named YUIPYON, while traveling in South Korea, was confronted by a passerby who inquired about her origin. Upon learning that YUIPYON was from Japan, the man, who identified himself as a North Korean defector, aggressively expressed his deep-seated resentment towards Japan, stating that he wanted to "kill all Japanese" and "beat them up". Despite YUIPYON's attempts to defuse the situation by expressing her love for South Korea and apologizing as a Japanese, the man continued with his verbal abuse, invoking historical grievances and even threatening to hit YUIPYON with a stone. The confrontation left YUIPYON in tears. Video of incident Translation Japanese YouTuber Threatened with "I'll hit you with a stone" and Harsh Verbal Abuse in South Korea Breaks Down in Tears Chuo Daily News Chuo Daily News Japanese Edition 2023.09.19 06 59 A Japanese YouTuber, active in South Korea, was verbally abused on the street by a middle-aged man, who yelled at him to "Go back to Japan", causing the YouTuber to break down in tears. On the 17th, a video titled "A Japanese who gave up everything in Japan to take a reckless challenge in South Korea" was released on the YouTube channel "YUIPYON". YUIPYON is a Japanese creator active in South Korea, boasting 610,000 subscribers. In the video, YUIPYON was traveling in South Korea with another Japanese creator, "YUSPYON". The problematic scene in the video began when a passerby asked YUIPYON, "Where are you from?". When YUIPYON replied, "I am from Japan", the man introduced himself saying, "I am from North Korea but defected to South Korea". Initially, YUIPYON seemed curious, wondering if the man was truly from North Korea. The issue escalated from there. The man, raising his voice, asked, "Aren't the South and North the same ethnicity? Do you know which country I hate the most?". YUIPYON awkwardly laughed and replied, "Japan". The man then suddenly began hurling abuse at YUIPYON, saying, "I want to kill all Japanese" and "I want to beat them up". A flustered YUIPYON tried to defuse the situation, saying, "Despite that, we came here because we love South Korea". However, the man continued with aggressive words, saying, "Do not say such things to Koreans. I'll hit you with a stone". YUSPYON, who was with him, tried to calm the situation by saying, "I understand", but the man continued, "Didn't Korea live as a possession of Japan for 31 years?". YUIPYON, unable to bear it any longer, retorted, "I am aware of that, but your words are too harsh". The man replied, "It is not that they are too harsh, but that the resentment Han is deeply ingrained. I hate Japan the most. I refer to the Japanese people as censored ". He raised his voice, "My grandfather died because of the Japanese. The resentment is ingrained in me as his grandson". In response, YUIPYON said, "I am truly sorry as a Japanese" and eventually broke down in tears. However, the man did not stop his verbal abuse. He continued, "Dokdo Takeshima in Japanese is Korea's territory", "Get out of South Korea", "Never come to Korean territory again", and finally left after hurling more harsh words. Even after the man left, YUIPYON could not stop crying. On the other hand, YUSPYON said with a sigh, "Still, he is not entirely wrong". As of 9 PM on the 18th, the video had surpassed 150,000 views. Comments included reactions such as, "As a Korean, I want to apologize on his behalf. Many Koreans are not like that, so please do not misunderstand", "My eldest daughter is studying English in the UK and has faced some racial discrimination. Watching the video reminded me of her and I was very angry at the man. I support YUIPYON", "I was very upset and ashamed when I saw a video of a Korean YouTuber being ignored and discriminated against in Japan just because they are Korean. I am very sorry that there are such abnormal people in Korea", and "I was shocked, but I was moved by the effort to understand the other person".

They even pulled off a whopping 600 million heist from the Ronin blockchain of the game Axie Infinity, it seems. And they targeted CoinsPaid, snatching 37 million there. They did all this using some tricky methods to hide their money through various crypto chains. These guys are something else!

My question is, if I hvae a phyiscal visa in my paspsort, will I have trouble returning to the US? I've checked OFAC rules, and it clearly states that while US persons can go to and from DPRK, the use of a US passport is invalid. I don't want to get flagged and I'm dreading I will have the SSSS on boarding passes in the future. Can someone who has been in the same situation as me help me out? Thanks!

Title: North Korea's Kim Jong-un miscalculation tarnishes China's reputation
Content: North Korea's Kim Jong-un miscalculation tarnishes China's reputation Recently, North Korea's closeness to Russia has been highlighted. At the Russia-North Korea summit, Kim Jong-un said that "Russia is the most important country in North Korea's foreign relations." This is a denial of the fact that North Korea has always said that China is its most important ally. By saying that Russia is more important than China, North Korea has damaged China's diplomatic standing. Why did Kim make this statement? He may be eager to strengthen ties with Russia, but this comment reveals the North Korean leader's delusions he overestimates Russia's capabilities. At the summit, Russia also touted good relations with North Korea on the surface, but a closer look reveals that something important is missing. When North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia, he was accompanied by the commander of the North Korean Navy. This is because North Korea is desperate for nuclear submarine technology. However, they did not visit Russia's submarine facilities. It is likely that North Korea asked Russia to visit its nuclear submarine facilities, but Russia refused. Instead, Putin showed Kim Jong-un a Su-57 fighter jet, which is expensive and difficult to maintain, making it unaffordable for North Korea. Russia is unlikely to provide the advanced weapons technology that North Korea hopes to acquire. Russia has tried to keep the relationship limited to providing conventional weapons, such as ammunition and artillery shells, and oil and food to North Korea. However, North Korea's Kim refused the food aid. Instead, he demanded advanced weapons technology. In the end, North Korea's relationship with China is likely to deteriorate and it will not get what it wants from Russia. And if China expresses its displeasure with North Korea's insubordination, Kim Jong-un's standing will suffer. In the past, during the Cold War, North Korea received significant support from the Soviet Union and China, so Kim Jong-un may have had high expectations in the current neo-Cold War situation. However, unlike the past, North Korea may not have as much to gain.

Content: My parents are really worried about North Korea I was in South Korea for the whole month of August with my fiancé. Before I even going I heard it all from my parents of their worry regarding North Korea. My fiancé and I had countless conversations about this and he assured me in South Korea no one is scared of Kim Jung Un and see him as a joke. He also told me that his dad who wad the top military official in Korea and now retired isn t even worried about North Korea. I tried telling my parents that and they said that people there live with blinders over their eyes. I tried talking to them but it got no where. I even expressed how we live in New York it s dangerous here and they shut me down. Now with everything going on with Israel and Palestine my mom turned around and said she s concerned that North Korea will retaliate. I feel so worried because my fiancé is currently there. I just wonder if anyone here has facts, opinions, and advice to share. I don t know if I m being ignorant or are my parents the ignorant ones?

Title: Korea to become a multi-racial country starting next year, the first country outside of North America and Europe
Content: Korea to become a multi-racial country starting next year, the first country outside of North America and Europe summary The 5 proportion of foreigners is meaningful as a standard figure for classifying countries and societies as multiracial in demographics. Korea is the first region outside of North America and Europe Strangely, many oil-producing countries in the Middle East with many foreign workers do not seem to be considered multiracial countries. 외국인 5 는 인구 통계학계와 국제기구 등에서 통용되는 다인종 다문화 국가의 기준이다. 유럽과 북미 외 지역에서 다문화 다인종 국가가 나오는 것은 한국이 사실상 처음이다. It may be modified, but the current article reads as follows. It is consistent with the title I wrote. In Japan, the proportion of foreigners is 2.38 2.99 million out of 125 million people , which is significantly higher than in Korea - ------------- However, looking at the reactions of many Koreans, it seems like they are okay with multi-racialism, but are absolutely against multi-culturalism. This is also true for young people. There are many responses saying that a single culture policy is urgent, and the majority of responses seem to be that they will accept foreigners if they perfect assimilate into Korean culture.

Content: No news about Kim Jong un himself? Somebody asked this question before on here. I can only see old news Russia, Putin, exchange of arms, shutting down of embassies . But, where's Kim Jong un? No events or sites visited by him. It's getting boring to always read the same old news. I have a habit of searching on NK every day. Also, if anyone has come across news of him then feel to share. Can also share websites, platforms with more NK news.

Title: Why hasn't the Korean peninsula had a federal/centralized government in its thousands year history?
Content: Why hasn't the Korean peninsula had a federal centralized government in its thousands year history? I just feel like it would make more sense if Koreans just opted for a more decentralized yet ethnically homogenous state, because of how stubborn many Koreans are in their nature. I've travelled to Korea for many years, and despite their uniform language and food, there seems to be pretty vast differences in terms of what each province region needs for its own economic and cultural development. Korea has had a very long history of basically hating each other's guts dating way back to the Jin and Gojoseon era, and proto- Three Kingdoms era. Heck, I'd even argue that cultural remnants of these different different still remain in different parts of South Korea Chungcheong, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, etc.. . And, don't even get me started on cultural and economic differences between the North and South. In fact, I think the process of decentralizing the state may be even more important if Korea were to reunify in the distant future. Even if Korea were to reunify gradually and safely, theres no doubt the Northern and South Provinces will still have massive cultural differences and mindsets. So why not, give each province more control and autonomy? Perhaps, a Federal Republic of United Korea,instead of the Republic of Korea, would be more conducive for a stable polity?

Lies like "north korea was just trying to liberate the south" or how everything you learned about north korea is a lie because cia even though we have tons of sources that aren't cia related. I also love how she says "I hope I'm not speaking out of turn as an American, I cannot voice exclusively the wants and needs of the Korean people" WHEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING. The vast majority of South Koreans are very much in favor of the Korea US alliance. What tankies like that wants is to break the alliance which would absolutely screw us over

Content: What if Kim Jong-un executed an ambassador of an embassy of a foreign country in North Korea? We all know how ruthless Kim and his North Korea is. We all know how horrific their camps are. We know how the tragic story of Otto Warmbier have unfolded. But I present you a scenario where not a tourist, but an ambassador intentionally or accidentally stepped outside of the line Kim doesn't seem to like. And North Korea, being North Korea, decided to give him a taste of torture. Excuse my poor understanding of diplomacy Picture this using Embassy Of Sweden, Pyongyang as an example. Ambassadors there discuss over whatever new policies North Korea has enacted and one of them staunchly disagreed. However, the North Korean government who has been spying on them felt threatened that the Swede in the embassy criticised the government and so decided to execute them under Kim's orders. How would that go? How would a country whose ambassador's origin got executed, react ex. Sweden ? Could this be considered an act of war?

I know the topic of birthrate comes up every week nowadays, and many are sick of it, but I'm curious why Japan on average has higher birthrates than South Korea does. Japan's birthrate in 2022 was 1.26 while South Korea's was 0.78. Both are bad, but Japan's birthrate seems to be relatively consistent while Korea's is constantly free falling. Why is this? Japan and South Korea both seem relatively similar they're both East Asian Capitalist economies etc, so I think the comparison is fair.

Title: How is the Korean War generally understood in South Korea?
Content: How is the Korean War generally understood in South Korea? I live in the U.S., and the Korean War is generally understood in one of three ways 1. The general public has forgotten it or thinks of it as a footnote between WWII and the Vietnam War despite the fact that it was a major event at the time and tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers fought and died . 2. Anti-communists and the mainstream narrative see it as a heroic defense of a democratic country against unprovoked, Hitler-esque communist aggression despite the brutal suppression of dissidents by Syngman Rhee and the decision to cross the 38th Parallel and reunify the country on U.S. terms 3. Critics of U.S. foreign policy see it as another example of U.S. imperialism due to Japanese collaborators authoritarian repression in the ROK government, No Gun Ri massacre, and heavy bombing of North Korea despite the fact that North Korea started the war and is a horrible totalitarian regime I m curious to learn how Koreans understand the Korean War and associated issues like relationship with the U.S., the dictatorships that have ruled South Korea, and current relations with North Korea.

Scenario 1 North Korea modernizes their military and builds enough nukes to the point they can reliably invade the South without getting instantly annihilated by America and her allies. As a result, the Kim regime orders an invasion of South Korea, now that they can reliably hold their own against America, South Korea, and Japan. Scenario 2 Accidential escalation.

Content: Question about the birth rate. How are working conditions for government workers in South Korea? There are many discussions about what the government can do to raise fertility rates and some focus on competition and poor work life balance. Since the state controls conditions in its workplaces so are there serious attempts to create good environments for working parents and, if yes, do they have any measurable impact?

Title: Is Maria Skłodowska Curie popular in South Korea? What do Koreans think about her?
Content: Is Maria Skłodowska Curie popular in South Korea? What do Koreans think about her? Hello, I would like to ask you whether Maria Skłodowska Curie is well known in South Korea? I live in Warsaw, Poland and I am writing a short article about the reception of Marie by Koreans. I see that Koreans like to visit a museum that is located in the birthplace of a famous scientist. This year, in our city, a screening of the Korean musical "Marie Curie" took place in one of the cinemas. On the Internet, I also found a statement by the ambassador of South Korea to Poland, who even states that girls in Korea often grow up with the biography of a scientist. In a way, what I read answers my question, but I would also like to know if Maria is actually a well-known person in your country and I don't read Korean. I would also like to be able to read the statement of someone I did not meet in Warsaw. When someone visits a place, they are naturally interested, regardless of their origin. What do you think about her? Does your education system in any way use the biographies of her and other distinguished scientists, setting them as role models? If you had the opportunity, would you visit places related to her? I will be grateful for every answer and thank you in advance. Greetings from Poland.

Title: Will North Korea end up conquering the South because the South doesn't have children?
Content: Will North Korea end up conquering the South because the South doesn't have children? So right now South Korea has the lowest fertility rate of any country, it's even below 1 child per woman. So what I've been thinking lately is it doesn't matter if your productive system is better, you have a higher GDP per capita, you have better relations with most countries and all that, if at the end you don't have children. North Korea, regardless of how poor they are and how tense their relations are with other countries, keeps having children at an acceptable rate, so at some point they will outnumber their neighbor in the South and this will tip the balance on their favour. What do you think it can happen?

Title: Do you personally know any South Koreans who blame America for why North Korea is poor?
Content: Do you personally know any South Koreans who blame America for why North Korea is poor? One of my friends is one of the handful of South Koreans who think Korea would have been better off if the United Nations hasn't intervened to expel North Korea when it invaded South Korea. He argues that sanctions are the reason for their woes. He also thinks the rest of Korea are brainwashed, but not him. He is angry that 90 percent of Koreans dislike China amd thinks its just because of western propaganda. He blames the US for provoking the north, and for preventing NK from signing a peace treaty to end the war. He calls SK a client state, and thinks the US should withdraw from South Korea completely. I tried to explain that its in SK's interests to have US bases, and if there weren't then there wouldn't be any tripwire units to be bombed which automatically would pull the US into defending Korea. I got annoyed and told him that if he SK had lost the war, he could have starved to death. Even if he didn't he would have been left in an isolated country with a poverty level between that of NK and China, and had to kiss a dictator's ass, not known the wonder of the internet, and wasted ten years of his life in conscription. I still haven't been able to convince him differently. How common are people like this in South Korea? Do you have any stories of people in your life like this who blame the US for North Korea's predicament?

Title: Best place to have concert in North Korea?
Content: Best place to have concert in North Korea? Hey y'all We are Raven and the Dark Shadows, a brand-new rock band out of Miami Beach, Florida. Our studio album features members of Pearl Jam, Agent Fresco, and New Found Glory. We are excited to start our tour in the Spring of 2024 and are looking at potential destinations. We are trying to find cool venues, something like an old church or an old theater, with seating capacity from 100-300 guests. An old abandoned building, barn,, or field would also be cool, if available. We d like to make a documentary about the tour, so we prefer cinematic places over traditional rock clubs. It's hard to do this kind of search on google, so I figured it's best to ask here, since I will be doing the majority of planning for the tour. One last thing, if you guys have any recs on local poster artists, please tag their IG's or names. Food and off-the-beaten track sites are also much appreciated. Especially places pertaining to local music history. Hope to hear some great suggestions, and thank you in advance, Raven and the Dark Shadows

Title: Support North Korea against South Korea
Content: Support North Korea against South Korea This is my opinion and I can have the freedom of speech to talk. So you have United Korea United Korea used to be allies with the Soviet Union and China since their lands were so close If people don't know there's something called 'the Korean nature" Taekwondo used to be the hobby of the Koreans It's where you starve and punch trees down and walk on glass and Etc United Korea also once stated that television such as the first TV invented was damaging people's minds and there should be no internet or television in the country That was until United Korea got split apart The Southern Koreans were the fake Koreans that didn't want to be in the Korean nature who now have underage Japanese anime girls around the streets and have televisions all over And what about North Korea? The Northern Koreans responded aggressively to this and they declare them as the fake Koreans they are the North Koreans didn't know how to react so they needed someone to leave them on what they need to do next Kim Il Sung invaded South Korea in 1950 for this he died of a heart attack years later and Kim Jong-un is the new leader of North Korea North Korea has every single right to invade and attack South Korea cuz the real Koreans which are the North Koreans got their land taken by the south Koreans That land is important to North Korea and this situation has the same with Russia and Palestine and Serbia which all got their lands taken by another country and the world is supporting the wrong side Kim Jong-un couldn't do nothing and he knows that his people is going to leave his country immediately when he's going to threaten War He has no chance but to keep them sealed in the country and the people dying are weak who don't deserve to live anyway If they were born as a North Korean then they should have joined the army and they would have gave them so much food and medicine in the first place Kim Jong-un has no other choice but to do this and he already knows that the world is not going to care like what they did to Palestine and not let the world leaders have the freedom of speech "USA . these little countries that steal from others are so innocent and we're going to kill the victims" killusa freeNorthKorea EndSouthKorea

Content: Will North Korea ever invade South Korea again? The question is if round 2 on the Korean Peninsula will ever happen, either deliberately or by accident Scenario 1 Kim Jong Un orders massive military reform and modernization. After 10 years, he has modernized to the point where North Korea can hold its own against America and South Korea. As a result, Kim orders an invasion. Scenario 2 Accidential escalation. Miscommunication between America and North Korea leads to Kim believing that America will launch preemptive nuclear strikes against his regime. As a result, Kim Jong Un orders his own preemptive nuclear strike against Seoul as well as American bases in South Korea.

Title: Why do you think north Korean media now refers to South Korea as “Republic of Korea”?
Content: Why do you think north Korean media now refers to South Korea as Republic of Korea ? I believe it was earlier this year that north Korean media has begun to refer to South Korea by its official name, usually in quotes Republic of Korea or ROK . This is in tandem with the usual petulant labels of region of south Korean puppets and south Korea with south in lowercase. However, I ve recently noticed while browsing kcnawatch.org that several articles by the Rodong Sinmun referred to South Korea by its official name without quotes Republic of Korea . I read somewhere that this is an attempt by the north Korean regime to do what East Germany did in the 1970s, when it unofficially gave up the goal of reunification and began to view West Germany as a foreign country like any other as opposed to a special inter-German relationship.

Title: Dear friends from South Korea, as a Mongolian born in China, I would like to explain China's ethnic policies and Korean ethnic group situation.why the Chinese government likes to showcase actors wearing Korean ethnic costumes Additionally, I aim to dispel some misconceptions.
Content: Dear friends from South Korea, as a Mongolian born in China, I would like to explain China's ethnic policies and Korean ethnic group situation.why the Chinese government likes to showcase actors wearing Korean ethnic costumes Additionally, I aim to dispel some misconceptions. Firstly, these actions are not intended to claim that Korean ethnic costumes and cultures belong to China. Instead, they aim to showcase the well-being of these ethnic groups under Chinese rule. The Chinese constitution theoretically states that China is not exclusively for the Han ethnic group, even though the Han population exceeds 90 . More than half of China's territory is inhabited by ethnic minorities among the 56 officially recognized by the state. Thus, you will see actors wearing the traditional costumes of all 56 ethnic groups in various events to emphasize the unity of the Chinese nation. Some Chinese internet trolls may claim that China's Korean ethnic group is the true descendant of Goguryeo, or that China's Mongolian ethnic group is the descendant of the Golden Family. However, these opinions represent a tiny fraction of the population. While the Chinese Communist Party has its flaws and makes foolish decisions, it does not go to the extent of changing its foreign policy just to appease a group of internet trolls. For instance, officially recognized ethnic groups in China include Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Dai, and even Russians. The appearance of actors in traditional costumes representing these ethnic groups in an event is merely a propaganda strategy and does not imply any attempt by the Chinese government to appropriate the cultures of these minorities or to assert territorial ambitions over Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Thailand, or Russia. Secondly, despite the legal equality of the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, certain minority groups, such as the Manchu, Mongolian, Korean, Zhuang, Tibetan, Hui, Miao, and Uighur, hold higher political positions. The Korean ethnic group's situation is particularly unique, given that they lack significant population numbers or vast territories. Their elevated status is attributed to the crucial role played by Korean soldiers in the Chinese Communist Party's rise to power. The Fourth Field Army led by Lin Biao, a crucial force in the Communist Party, had one-fifth of its soldiers being Korean. These soldiers, raised in challenging environments, significantly contributed to both the Communist Party's victory in China and Kim Il-sung's initiation of the Korean War. This historical contribution has led to a disproportionately high number of Korean ethnic individuals in senior positions within the Chinese military, despite their small population size. While there are only two million Chinese Koreans, they have produced one general, two major generals, and seven brigadier generals a total of ten high-ranking officers. In contrast, the much larger Manchu ethnic group, with a population of ten million, has only twenty generals. This explains why Korean ethnic representation is prevalent in activities organized by the Chinese Communist Party, serving as a form of appeasement towards minority groups. This policy has persisted since the establishment of the People's Republic of China and is unlikely to change easily. However, some friends from South Korea may question whether the Chinese government has not canceled Korean language education or gradually closed Korean language schools. In reality, the Chinese government's assimilation policies and preferential treatment towards the Korean ethnic group are not contradictory. Historically, during the Ming Dynasty, many Mongolian nobles were attracted by the wealth offered by Zhu Yuanzhang and joined the Ming Dynasty. However, after several generations, these individuals lost their Mongolian traditions and language, and their military prowess became indistinguishable from ordinary Chinese. Consequently, their preferential treatment rapidly disappeared. China's Korean ethnic group is currently experiencing the end of a similar process. For example, the descendants of Korean military personnel living in major cities no longer speak Korean. Living in comfortable environments, they have lost the combat capabilities of their ancestors. This phenomenon extends to young Koreans in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, where many no longer speak Korean. As the advantage of Korean individuals in the military diminishes, and most young Koreans lose their language, culture, and distinctiveness, the exposure of Chinese Koreans in the propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party is likely to decrease. In some regions, the welfare benefits that Korean individuals once enjoyed, such as priority admission to universities and government institutions, have already been revoked. For those familiar with Chinese history, such stories have occurred many times in China's history. Since the Tang Dynasty, as the civil service examination system and centralization of power deepened, the status of military generals declined. They were often persecuted and eventually led to the decline of military strength in China. Despite the Chinese empire having wealth, it relied on assimilated foreign soldiers and commanders. However, as these foreign soldiers gradually became Sinicized, their combat capabilities also declined. This historical pattern is observable in both the Ming and Qing dynasties. Even in the military of the Chinese Communist Party, most commanders and soldiers come from regions that have recently undergone Sinicization, such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. Although these regions have been Sinicized, some remnants of non-Han customs and characteristics make the individuals from these areas more combat-capable than the rest of the empire. As a result, these areas have produced a disproportionately large number of generals in the People's Liberation Army. In summary, the ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party can be likened to a pitcher plant it provides benefits, but your ultimate fate is assimilation and elimination. While it's challenging to determine whether this outcome is an inevitable consequence of the Chinese imperial system or an initial plan of the Chinese Communist Party, it is a recurring theme in Chinese history.

Title: North Korea confronts a modern-day challenge: a declining population
Content: North Korea confronts a modern-day challenge a declining population According to United Nations' assessments, the average North Korean woman has 1.79 children over her lifetime, a rate that falls short of 2.1 needed to maintain the population. Many countries struggle with declining birth rates, including South Korea, which currently has the world's lowest rate of 0.78. But the challenge is primarily one that developed countries face. That North Korea, one of the world's poorest economies, also is facing a declining population makes its case an outlier.... North Korea introduced universal education much earlier than other developing nations, according to the study, and encouraged young people to marry late. Concerned that a growing population would burden its economy the total fertility rate neared 4 by then the country also made contraception and abortion available in the 1970s. As a result, compared to other low-income countries, North Korea has had lower maternal mortality rates, a lower adolescent fertility rate, a higher age of women at their first marriage, and higher adult literacy. Almost all young women received secondary education by the 1960s... In the 1990's, Women started seeking survival through unofficial economic activities amid growing marketization to support their families in place of men, who were forced into unpaid labor by the government... Traditional gender roles ... allowed women to be relatively free to leave government-assigned workplaces... Women became the sole breadwinner of their family... Young people now delay marriage and prioritize access to wealth, rather than to power, when looking for a spouse. In an aforementioned survey, a majority said that women started having a stronger voice in their households while men's power dwindled.

Title: Depictions of South Korea in TV and Film - Classism and Abuse
Content: Depictions of South Korea in TV and Film - Classism and Abuse So from my albeit limited exposure to South Korean Film and Television, I've noticed a trend of Classism and Abuse. Squid Games - Wealthy person forces people into sadistic games to fight for money Parasite - Poor people living in a rich familys home using there resources. Happiness - tv show - where rich residents of a building look down on public residents - and using money tempt them into dangerous situations. From what I've seen there is a strong dynamic of rich people treating poor people poorly and often using money to degrade humilate them and to put them into bad situations. It feels nasty and disturbing. Is this dehumanising a real trend in south korea. Im trying to compare it to the west, and I just keep thinking that all though class still exisits - it doesnt feel as outwardly abusive and nasty. In some areas of the west, there feels to be a stronger working class resilience. Does any one have any comments on this.

Title: Every continent’s North Korea
Content: Every continent s North Korea So I saw a video today talking about Albania s past, and how Albania used to be Europe s North Korea when it was ruled by Enver Hoxha from 1944 to 1985. It s also been well documented that the economic situation and human rights situation in Eritrea has suffered since its independence from Ethiopia, which has led to quite a few media outlets labeling this country Africa s North Korea . Both of these two countries got me to thinking, it could be kind of interesting to come up with a list of every continent s sorry Antarctica, not including you North Korea , or the country whose economic, political, and human rights environment most closely matches North Korea. In no particular order, here is my stab at this thought experiment Asia s North Korea North Korea Africa s North Korea Eritrea Europe s North Korea Belarus North America s North Korea Cuba dis honorable mention to Nicaragua South America s North Korea Venezuela Oceania s North Korea Unsure

Title: How bad is racism in korea towards south east asian men
Content: How bad is racism in korea towards south east asian men I am learning korea nowadays because I am planning to take master degrees in KAIST. But i am scared of the racism news towards south east asians that I am reading online. I am a Filipino and I heard they hate Filipino people. My korean tutor told me I should not worry about such thing because it is just rare occurrence and pretty privilege is stronger than racism in Korea. He told me I can live normally in SK because of those things he said I look like sean kauffman and if I managed to graduate from KAIST it will be a good thing as well. But I think he is just pulling my leg PS I know people have stereotypes that Filipinos are dark skinned but I don t belong in those stereotypes. I am light skinned Filipino naturally I am even fairer than some of my Japanese colleagues

Title: South Korea is broken.
Content: South Korea is broken. South Korea is a dystopian society which is collapsing as we speak. It's fertility is dropping to unholy levels 0.6 and it's government is basically controlled by the chaebols. This means cultural and societal changes that are necessary to raise fertility will simply not happen. Other countries have fertility issues as well, but Korea is easily the worst and it's government is so limited in what can be done. In my opinion, South Korea needs a cultural revolution, in which the crazy working hours are scrapped, the horrible private education is scrapped and marriage is made reasonable for the average Korean. This sounds extreme, but a TFR of 0.6 needs extreme solutions. Your thoughts?

Title: Would a Korean war necessarily draw in Japan and the United States
Content: Would a Korean war necessarily draw in Japan and the United States It seems interesting how any war with North Korea involving the US will very, very rapidly escalate into a "use it or lose it" situation in regards to their 80 nuclear weapons, which special forces would move into position and attempt to neutralize as rapidly as possible. Presumably, this would mean it would quickly become a nuclear war scenario. But what if it was just South Korea VS North Korea? Would the US and Japan be inclined to rush to South Korea's defense, knowing that it would result in nuclear warfare? Is there a possibility it wouldn't result in such?

Content: Is PharmD degree recognized in South Korea? I'm a Korean national student with dual citizenship in Canada and South Korea, but I study in Canada at the moment, from a young age, I've always wanted to live in Korea. I've lived abroad for most of my life, but from a young age, I only imagined myself living in Korea. I still have some ways to go with my degree but I just want to know if the PharmD degree is recognized. I don't know what industry I want to work in, I know I'm going to stay in Canada for a little bit and build some experience but, I'm hoping once I get to Korea, I can work in the pharmaceutical industry as an R D researcher. I know I'll have to take an exam once I get to Korea to practise as a pharmacist. I want to leave Canada because of the high cost of living. I'm an independent student, I pay for everything, including my tuition, but one trip to the groceries is 30-40 dollars, and rent for a crappy room is like 900 a month, and with that money, I know I can increase the quality of life in South Korea. Also, I never really felt assimilated in this country, I always felt like an outsider. There's an increase in crime, and although I respect all sexualities, the increase in gender identity sometimes frustrates me, because I feel like racism is much more prevalent than gender identity issues.

Title: An overview of South Korea's primary tactics in addressing declining birth rates in 2024
Content: An overview of South Korea's primary tactics in addressing declining birth rates in 2024 I've compiled an overview of the policies currently being implemented by Korea to tackle low birth rates, as I find that information is all over the place and can be a bit confusing. Keep in mind that the benefits listed here will be coming from the central government. Parents may be able to access more specialized and additional subsidies from their local governments. 1. Special Exemption Savings Loan Program - A newly implemented mortgage program that comes into effect starting on January 30, allowing people under the age of 39 to be approved loans of up to 5억원 470K USD at below-market interest rates 4.65 5.05 depending on the price of the house for up to 50 years 40 years for people aged between 35 39, 50 years for people under 34 . The loan only applies to housing under 9억원 - 850K USD 2. New Child Benefit Program - Below is a good summary. Starting next year parents will receive 1Million Won per month for children 1 11 months old, 750,000 Won for children 12 23 months old. 3. '6 6' Parental Leave System Comes into effect Jan 1st. Basically, each parent is given 1950만원 each totalling 3900만원 for 6 months for babies under the age of 18 months increased from 12 months in 2023 . The couple can decide whether to use these subsidies all at once both taking leave or decide to space their payments out to a total of 12 months. In any case, the total they get is 39 million KRW. The payment starts at 200만원 and goes up every month by 50만원. By the end of each 6 months, the monthly subsidy will reach 450만원 eg. 200 250 300 350 400 450 1950 . This news clip offers a good overview Parents who have been using the 3 3 system this year will automatically be transferred to the 6 6 system, and will receive an amount totaling 3900, regardless of the incremental monthly pay. So parents who will have a baby on Jan 1st will be receiving 1200만원 Child benefit 3900만원 parental leave support 5100만원 from the central government in 2024. Besides these main financial subsidy programs, parents can expect to receive additional funding from their local governments. Incheon announced that they will be subsidizing a total of 1억원 100 million Won for babies born in the city until the age of 18 "시는 임신출산 의료비 지원 100만원, 첫만남 이용권 200만원, 부모급여 1천800만원, 아동수당 960만원, 보육료와 급식비 2천540만원, 초 중 고 교육비 1천650만원 등 기존 지원금 약 7천200만원을 유지하면서 추가로 약 2천800만원을 지원할 계획이다." Anyhow, these are the three major policy updates coming next year to encourage parents to have babies.

Is it the hierarchical society that teaches these lessons? Because even though i come from a country with high crime and poverty rates stories like those i ve heard from south korea or other asian countries are completely unimaginable. Has anyone done any research on this phenomenon?

Title: CMV: Modern America is no better than North Korea
Content: CMV Modern America is no better than North Korea Can't believe that I am posting this on Christmas, but here goes Social Media Most websites are very restrictive as to what you can post. Dissenting opinions are often shunned, leading to a ban. Transportation Public transportation in most of America is a joke. North Korea, on the other hand, has an excellent subway and bus system. Food Not many people in America are starving, but the food is low-quality. There is lots of high-fructose corn syrup, chemically refined oil, and enriched, bleached flour in our food. Even organic oil in the U.S. is chemically refined! As a result, the U.S. almost has the highest obesity rate in the world. Politics Most U.S. politicians are out of touch, and don't listen to people. Their policies are highly ineffective. Education The U.S. school system barely teaches anything useful, and there is too much grade inflation. Healthcare Highly overpriced, and low quality in many cases. Work Culture Lots of busywork, and the minimum workweek is usually 40 hours, not even including time to prepare for work. Many workplaces are very controlling. If I told some random Americans that this story happened in North Korea by changing the text, they would believe me Freedom Privacy Security cameras and ID card readers for recording people's information are very popular in the U.S., and there is usually no way to opt out from being recorded. Police are allowed to act abusively and lie during interrogations. I once was caught using these devices based on a small misunderstanding. Also, I was not informed of these devices and their capabilities beforehand. I was also abusively interrogated, though the charges were later dropped. I actually could have refused interrogation, and things would have gone better. But I was never told this they lied when they said I was required to come . In a similar case, someone I know lost his job as a TA because he made a joke using the phrase "manifest destiny" which was not used in the context of slavery . They made him wait two months for a college hearing. Yet I once heard some Middle eastern students chanting "The Jews have got to go!" and nothing happened to them.

We were talking about music. The North Korean guides were interested in American music, so I was was trying to explain what hip-hop was and how it started out as a black American subculture. One of the guides Mr Kim said "You mean " yes, he said the racist word! . I said "we don't say that because it is very offensive in our society". Mr Kim looked at me in confusion as to why we don't use that word as a descriptive term. Mr Kim responded "but I am yellow". That was probably the biggest culture shock I experienced in North Korea!

Absolutely devestated so I'm posting here to see if anyone has any insight on this. I'm born in the US and currently serving in the United States Navy as an officer. I always get hard time on my security clearance interview for Government related work because of my Korean Citizenship obtained through South Korean parents from South Korea. I tried to renounce korean citizenship through korean consulate in 2022, but I got a rejection notification from Supreme Court in South Korea today reason for the rejcetion was that "did not request to renounce korean citizenship when i was 18." The problem is that I had no idea I have to renounce korean citizenship honestly I thought I lost korean citizenship long time ago and parents are now permenant resident of the United States so there is no way I can get help on this. x200B Any advice what I should do to get rid of my korean citizenship? Korean citizenship is hindering my career and I want to get rid of it. Any insight or advice will be appreciated.

Title: I have a feeling that North Korea, China, and Russia will become biggest combined superpowers soon after January 1, 2024.
Content: I have a feeling that North Korea, China, and Russia will become biggest combined superpowers soon after January 1, 2024. Why? Because I have a feeling that January 1, 2024, will mark the end of Hollywood, Silicon Valley, NASA, mainstream media, and the United States of America in general as we're about to see over 170 names of rich and powerful people including former American presidents, Hollywood actors and directors, and so on who serially raped little girls with Jeffrey Epstein on his private island as mentioned here On January 1, 2024, the list of former presidents Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and Barack Obama are theorized to be on the list , America's richest people, America's high-ranking government officials, entrepreneurs, and famous celebrities participated in confining and sexually exploiting middle school and high school minors on Jeffrey Epstein's U.S. Virgin Islands island will all be revealed. Accordingly, there is a high possibility that very large repercussions will occur. In addition to economic losses, there is a high possibility that they will be buried socially as well. Some will not even be able to avoid judicial proceedings. In particular, there is a high possibility that anti-American countries such as China and Russia will use it as anti-American propaganda. The website is in Korean and I used Google Translate to translate that into English and fixed certain parts. There is also an article dealing with this Dozens of documents naming Jeffrey Epstein s victims and associates to be made public in 2024 A federal judge in New York has ordered the names of dozens of Jeffrey Epstein s alleged victims and associates to be made public in 2024, according to documents. The order, issued Monday by Judge Loretta A. Preska, is the latest filing in a settled case by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an American woman who claimed Epstein sexually abused her while she was a minor and that Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein s former girlfriend and longtime accomplice, aided in the abuse. Epstein was indicted in 2019 on federal charges of operating a sex trafficking ring in which he allegedly sexually abused dozens of underage girls. The multi-millionaire died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. Prosecutors in New York indicted Maxwell on sex trafficking charges involving multiple victims. She was convicted in 2021. While the 2015 defamation lawsuit brought by Giuffre was settled in 2017 and placed under a protective order, parts of it have been unsealed since then as Giuffre, Maxwell and a number of third-party figures have debated what should and shouldn t be released to the public. In August 2019, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unsealed hundreds of pages of documents a day before Epstein died in prison, ruling that the district court judge had improperly sealed hundreds of filings. That judge had since died. The appeals court then remanded the case back to the district court to go through the rest of the documents individually and determine what could be unsealed. Judge Preska, who has since taken over the case, ruled for the unsealing of more documents in July 2020, including Maxwell s 2016 deposition related to the lawsuit as well as emails and depositions by others. Many of the alleged victims gave public interviews and have already been identified by the media, while others did not raise an objection to the unsealing of documents, according to Preska s Monday order. Preska is giving the Jane and John Does 14 days to file an appeal before the parties confer and make the documents public. As for the Epstein associates, it s unclear how many have been investigated for alleged wrongdoing or will be. Some of the victims will remain unnamed, due to the sensitive nature of the crimes and sexual nature abuse of minors, the order says. The order says Epstein s associates, one of whom played a role in his sex trafficking crimes and another whose name came up in a criminal trial, will also have their documents unsealed in full. Some of the documents to be released include information of those who have died, including one person who died in 2018 but was widely associated with Epstein and featured in photos at Epstein s island residence on Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands, the order says. They also include people associated with Maxwell. After Epstein s death, the US attorney s office in Manhattan indicated it would focus on the conspiracy charge against Epstein, which accused him of working with employees and associates to operate a vast sex-trafficking ring involving dozens of girls. Epstein pleaded guilty to two Florida prostitution charges in 2008 and served 13 months in prison. The conspiracy count could allow prosecutors to charge anyone else involved in the scheme. This means that once that list is revealed, China, Russia, and North Korea will immediately claim that countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ukraine, and so on are entirely ruled by serial child rapists and use that as a reason to invade said countries and do so immediately to cleanse their moral bankruptcies and because they have absolute moral superiority, they will able to take over those countries in less than 1 hour since every single citizens and military of those countries will immediately side with China, Russia, and North Korea as they're far more morally superior and have no child rape whatsoever, especially ones that are connected to Epstein. Only Japan will be spared because they have no child rape at least according to some people on YouTube , making it the only democratic country left in the world while rest of the world will be ruled by China, Russia, and North Korea along with dictatorial countries that side with them for eternity. I mean, we have Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Ralph Fiennes, Kevin Spacey, Prince Andrew, and so on who are named as Epstein s clients and the new list might even have names like Steven Spielberg, James Gunn, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bob Iger, Pete Docter, Jim Morris, Kevin Feige, Dave Filoni, Clark Spencer, and so on - at least according to some people on the Internet. Maybe Russia, China, and North Korea will spare the United States as long as they agree to reinstate Donald Trump as the eternal president and have Disney and Hollywood in general run by people like Ben Shapiro, Ethan Van Sciver, Nelson Peltz, and Ike Perlmutter with Legendary Pictures being the only one allowed to operate since it's mostly owned by Wanda Group of China , while Silicon Valley is run by people like Elon Musk and NASA being run by people like David Weiss, and so on while the United Kingdom is getting taken over by Russia along with other European countries, South Korea is getting taken over by North Korea, and China is getting taken over by Taiwan in less than an hour or so as, again, all citizens and military of those countries side with China, Russia, and North Korea to cleanse child rape from their own countries - at least that seems to be what's being implied here. Thoughts on this?

Title: How should unification be handled if North Korea fell?
Content: How should unification be handled if North Korea fell? Let's have a serious dicussion. Let's say that the north korean regime fell, maybe with a coup with the help of the cia, and SK or the US took over the North before China, what would happen next? Let's leave aside the huge economic difference between the two countries, that wouldn't be too hard to treat, but how are we going to educate millions of adults who are deeply indoctrinated and know nothing about the rest of the world, that's way worse than in east germany. Should NK not be immediately annexed but rather rather treated as likea special region or protectorate and have something similar to a denazification program before they get to vote? And maybe meanwhile we make southern korean politicians rule their provinces and cities while we identify all those close to Kim's regime and disqualify them from holding office. Also maybe it could be the case to limit immigration from north to south in the first few years while we build the north back, or it would end up empty. Should we do something like this for 5-10 years and then let the country unify? You think that would be enough?
